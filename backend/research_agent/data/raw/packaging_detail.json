    "content": "A three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is a MOS (metal-oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit (IC) manufactured by stacking as many as 16 or more ICs and interconnecting them vertically using, for instance, through-silicon vias (TSVs) or Cu-Cu connections, so that they behave as a single device to achieve performance improvements at reduced power and with a smaller footprint than conventional two dimensional processes. The 3D IC is one of several 3D integration schemes that exploit the z-direction to achieve electrical performance benefits in microelectronics and nanoelectronics.\n3D integrated circuits can be classified by their level of interconnect hierarchy at the global (package), intermediate (bond pad) and local (transistor) level.  In general, 3D integration is a broad term that includes such technologies as 3D wafer-level packaging (3DWLP); 2.5D and 3D interposer-based integration; 3D stacked ICs (3D-SICs); 3D heterogeneous integration; and 3D systems integration; as well as true monolithic 3D ICs.\nInternational organizations such as the Jisso Technology Roadmap Committee (JIC) and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) have worked to classify the various 3D integration technologies to further the establishment of standards and roadmaps of 3D integration. As of the 2010s, 3D ICs are widely used for NAND flash memory and in mobile devices.",

    "content": "A chiplet is a tiny integrated circuit (IC) that contains a well-defined subset of functionality. It is designed to be combined with other chiplets on an interposer in a single package to create a complex component such as a computer processor. Each chiplet in a computer processor provides only a portion of the processor's total functionality. A set of chiplets can be implemented in a mix-and-match \"Lego-like\" assembly. This provides several advantages over a traditional system on chip (SoC) which is monolithic as it comprises a single silicon die:\n\nReusable IP (intellectual property): the same chiplet can be used in many different devices\nHeterogeneous integration: chiplets can be fabricated with different processes, materials, and nodes, each optimized for its particular function\nKnown good die: chiplets can be tested before assembly, improving the yield of the final device.\nMultiple chiplets working together in a single integrated circuit may be called a multi-chip module, hybrid IC, 2.5D IC, or an advanced package.\nChiplets may be connected with standards such as UCIe, bunch of wires (BoW), AIB (Advanced Interface Bus), OpenHBI (Open High Bandwidth Interface), and OIF (Optical Internetworking Forum) XSR (Extra Short Reach). Chiplets not designed by the same company must be designed with interoperability in mind.\nThe term was coined by University of California, Berkeley professor John Wawrzynek as a component of the RAMP Project (research accelerator for multiple processors) in 2006  extension for the Department of Energy.\nCommon examples include:\n\nAMD Ryzen based on Zen 2 and later architecture (except APUs)\nNVidia H100, and later\nIntel Sapphire Rapids / Meteor Lake / Arrow Lake, and later",

    "content": "A system in a package, or system in package (SiP), is a number of integrated circuits (ICs) enclosed in one  chip carrier package or encompassing an IC package substrate that may include passive components and perform the functions of an entire system. The ICs may be stacked using package on package, placed side by side, and/or embedded in the substrate. The SiP performs all or most of the functions of an electronic system, and is typically used when designing components for mobile phones, digital music players, etc. Dies containing integrated circuits may be stacked vertically on the package substrate. They are internally connected by fine wires that are bonded to the package substrate. Alternatively, with a flip chip technology, solder bumps are used to join stacked chips together and to the package substrate, or even both techniques can be used in a single package. SiPs are like systems on a chip (SoCs) but less tightly integrated and not on a single semiconductor die. \nSIPs can be used either to reduce the size of a system, improve performance or to reduce costs. The technology evolved from multi-chip module (MCM) technology, the difference being that SiPs also use die stacking, which stacks several chips or dies on top of each other.",

    "content": "An integrated circuit (IC), also known as a microchip or simply chip, is a compact assembly of electronic circuits formed from various electronic components — such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors — and their interconnections. \nThese components are fabricated onto a thin, flat piece (\"chip\") of semiconductor material, most commonly silicon. Integrated circuits are integral to a wide variety of electronic devices — including computers, smartphones, and televisions — performing functions such as data processing, control, and storage. They have transformed the field of electronics by enabling device miniaturization, improving performance, and reducing cost.\nChips can be connected to other chips, and other materials.\nCompared to assemblies built from discrete components, integrated circuits are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, more energy-efficient, and less expensive, allowing for a very high transistor count.\nThe ICs capability for mass production, its high reliability, and the standardized, modular approach of integrated circuit design facilitated rapid replacement of designs using discrete transistors. Today, ICs are present in virtually all electronic devices and have revolutionized modern technology. Products such as computer processors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and embedded processing chips in home appliances are foundational to contemporary society due to their small size, low cost, and versatility.\nVery-large-scale integration was made practical by technological advancements in semiconductor device fabrication. Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more transistors on chips of the same size – a modern chip may have many billions of transistors in an area the size of a human fingernail. These advances, roughly following Moore's law, make the computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.\nICs have three main advantages over circuits constructed out of discrete components: size, cost and performance. The size and cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and proximity. The main disadvantage of ICs is the high initial cost of designing them and the enormous capital cost of factory construction. This high initial cost means ICs are only commercially viable when high production volumes are anticipated.\n\n",

The technique was developed by General Electric's Light Military Electronics Department, Utica, New York. The solder bumps are deposited on the chip pads on the top side of the wafer during the final wafer processing step. In order to mount the chip to external circuitry (e.g., a circuit board or another chip or wafer), it is flipped over so that its top side faces down, and aligned so that its pads align with matching pads on the external circuit, and then the solder is reflowed to complete the interconnect. This is in contrast to wire bonding, in which the chip is mounted upright and fine wires are welded onto the chip pads and lead frame contacts to interconnect the chip pads to external circuitry.",

    "content": "A 2.5D integrated circuit (2.5D IC) is an advanced packaging technique that combines multiple integrated circuit dies in a single package without stacking them into a three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC) with through-silicon vias (TSVs). The term \"2.5D\" originated when 3D-ICs with TSVs were quite new and still very difficult. Chip designers realized that many of the advantages of 3D integration could be approximated by placing bare dies side by side on an interposer instead of stacking them vertically. If the pitch is very fine and the interconnect very short, the assembly can be packaged as a single component with better size, weight, and power characteristics than a comparable 2D circuit board assembly. This half-way 3D integration was facetiously named \"2.5D\" and the name stuck.\nSince then, 2.5D has proven to be far more than just \"half-way to 3D.\"\nAn interposer can support heterogeneous integration – that is, dies of different pitch, size, material, and process node. Placing dies side by side instead of stacking them reduces heat buildup. Upgrading or modifying a 2.5D assembly is as easy as swapping in a new component and revamping the interposer to suit; much faster and simpler than reworking an entire 3D-IC or System-on-Chip (SoC). Some sophisticated 2.5D assemblies even incorporate TSVs and 3D components. Several foundries now support 2.5D packaging.\nThe success of 2.5D assembly has given rise to \"chiplets\" – small, functional circuit blocks designed to be combined in mix-and-match fashion on interposers. Several high-end products already take advantage of these LEGO-style chiplets; some experts predict the emergence of an industry-wide chiplet ecosystem. Interposers can be larger than the reticle size which is the maximum area that can be projected by a photolithography scanner or stepper.",

    "content": "Hydrogen is a chemical element; it has the symbol H and atomic number 1. It is the lightest and most abundant chemical element in the universe, constituting about 75% of all normal matter. Under standard conditions, hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, called dihydrogen, or sometimes hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. Dihydrogen is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found as the gas H2 (dihydrogen) and in molecules, such as in water and organic compounds. The most common isotope of hydrogen, 1H, consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\nHydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the 17th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–1781, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned: this is the origin of hydrogen's name, which means 'water-former' (from Ancient Greek: ὕδωρ, romanized: húdōr, lit. 'water', and γεννάω, gennáō, 'I bring forth'). Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of the development of quantum mechanics.\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid–base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively-charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively-charged cation, H+, hydron. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, hydrons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH. Hydride, on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding H2.\nIn the early universe, neutral hydrogen atoms formed about 370,000 years after the Big Bang as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. After stars began to form, most of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium was re-ionized.\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from water or saline by electrolysis, but this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production for fertilizer. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.",

    "content": "Advanced packaging is the aggregation and interconnection of components before traditional integrated circuit packaging, where a single die is packaged.  Advanced packaging allows multiple devices, including electrical, mechanical, or semiconductor devices, to be merged and packaged as a single electronic device. Advanced packaging uses processes and techniques that are typically performed at semiconductor fabrication facilities, unlike traditional integrated circuit packaging, which does not. Advanced packaging thus sits between fabrication and traditional packaging -- or, in other terminology, between BEoL and post-fab.  Advanced packaging includes multi-chip modules, 3D ICs, 2.5D ICs, heterogeneous integration, fan-out wafer-level packaging, system-in-package, quilt packaging, combining logic (processors) and memory in a single package, die stacking, wafer bonding/stacking, several chiplets or dies in a package, combinations of these techniques, and others. 2.5D and 3D ICs are also called 2.5D or 3D packages.\nAdvanced packaging can help achieve performance gains through the integration of several devices in one package and associated efficiency gains (by reducing the distances signals have to travel, in other words, reducing signal paths), and allowing for a high number of connections between devices, without relying on smaller transistors, which have become increasingly more difficult to manufacture. This mitigates the rising costs and yield degradation associated with monolithic (advanced) nodes by enabling heterogeneous integration, where mature nodes are used for analog/IO and advanced nodes are reserved for the core logic. Fan-out packaging is seen as a low-cost option for advanced packaging.\nAdvanced Packaging is considered fundamental in expanding Moore’s Law. An example of heterogeneous integration is Intel's EMIB, which uses \"bridges\" made on silicon substrates to connect different dies together. Another example is TSMC's CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) technology, which uses an interposer. Advanced packaging is closely related to system integration, used in systems related to \"artificial intelligence, machine learning, automotive, and 5G,\" to name a few. System integration consists of \"ways to avoid putting everything on a single chip by creating a system that interconnects multiple smaller chips, or chiplets\". Advanced packages can have chiplets from several vendors. To enable this, standards for connecting chiplets have been developed, such as\nUCie.",

PCBs are used to connect or \"wire\"  components to one another in an electronic circuit.  Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers, generally by  soldering, which both electrically connects and mechanically fastens the components to the board. Another manufacturing process adds vias, metal-lined drilled holes that enable electrical interconnections between conductive layers, to boards with more than a single side.\nPrinted circuit boards are used in nearly all electronic products today. Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Electronic design automation software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation. Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout has to be done only once.  PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.\nPCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (stacked layers of substrate with copper plating sandwiched between each and on the outside layers). Multi-layer PCBs provide much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components. The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of surface-mount technology. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.\nThe world market for bare PCBs exceeded US$60.2 billion in 2014, and was estimated at $80.33 billion in 2024, forecast to be $96.57 billion for 2029, growing at 4.87% per annum.",

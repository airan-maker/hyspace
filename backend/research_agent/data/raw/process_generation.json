    "content": "A fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) is a multigate device, a MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) built on a substrate where the gate is placed on two, three, or four sides of the channel or wrapped around the channel (gate all around), forming a double or even multi gate structure. These devices have been given the generic name \"FinFETs\" because the source/drain region forms fins on the silicon surface. The FinFET devices exhibit significantly faster switching times and higher current density than planar CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology, resulting in enhanced performance and power efficiency.[1]\nFinFET is a type of non-planar transistor, or \"3D\" transistor. It is the basis for modern nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication. Microchips utilizing FinFET gates first became commercialized in the first half of the 2010s, and became the dominant gate design at 14 nm, 10 nm and 7 nm process nodes.\nIt is common for a single FinFET transistor to contain several fins, arranged side by side and all covered by the same gate, that act electrically as one. The number of fins can be varied to adjust drive strength and performance, with drive strength increasing with a higher number of fins.",

    "content": "A multigate device, multi-gate MOSFET or multi-gate field-effect transistor (MuGFET) refers to a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) that has more than one gate on a single transistor. The multiple gates may be controlled by a single gate electrode, wherein the multiple gate surfaces act electrically as a single gate, or by independent gate electrodes. A multigate device employing independent gate electrodes is sometimes called a multiple-independent-gate field-effect transistor (MIGFET). The most widely used multi-gate devices are the FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) and the GAAFET (gate-all-around field-effect transistor), which are non-planar transistors, or 3D transistors.\nMulti-gate transistors are one of the several strategies being developed by MOS semiconductor manufacturers to create ever-smaller microprocessors and memory cells, colloquially referred to as extending Moore's law (in its narrow, specific version concerning density scaling, exclusive of its careless historical conflation with Dennard scaling). Development efforts into multigate transistors have been reported by the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Toshiba, Grenoble INP, Hitachi, IBM, TSMC, UC Berkeley, Infineon Technologies, Intel, AMD, Samsung Electronics, KAIST, Freescale Semiconductor, and others, and the ITRS predicted correctly that such devices will be the cornerstone of sub-32 nm technologies. The primary roadblock to widespread implementation is manufacturability, as both planar and non-planar designs present significant challenges, especially with respect to lithography and patterning. Other complementary strategies for device scaling include channel strain engineering, silicon-on-insulator-based technologies, and high-κ/metal gate materials.\nDual-gate MOSFETs are commonly used in very high frequency (VHF) mixers and in sensitive VHF front-end amplifiers. They are available from manufacturers such as Motorola, NXP Semiconductors, and Hitachi.",

It is a type of photolithography that uses 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from a laser-pulsed tin (Sn) plasma to create intricate patterns on semiconductor substrates. \nAs of 2025, ASML Holding is the only company that produces and sells EUV systems for chip production, targeting 5 nanometer (nm) and 3 nm process nodes, though Reuters reported in December 2025 that China had developed its own prototype EUV system.\nThe EUV wavelengths that are used in EUVL are near 13.5 nanometers (nm), using a laser-pulsed tin (Sn) droplet plasma to produce a pattern by using a reflective photomask to expose a substrate covered by photoresist.  Tin ions in the ionic states from Sn IX to Sn XIV give photon emission spectral peaks around 13.5 nm from 4p64dn – 4p54dn+1 + 4dn−14f ionic state transitions.\n\n",

    "content": "The5 nanometer (5 nm) lithography processis atechnology nodesemiconductor manufacturing process following the7 nm processnode. Commercialintegrated circuitmanufacturing using 5 nm process is set to begin sometime around 2020.\n\nThe term \"5 nm\" is simply a commercial name for a generation of a certain size and its technology, anddoes notrepresent any geometry of the transistor.\n\nFirst introduced by the major foundries around the2020timeframe, the 5-nanometerprocess technologyis characterized by its use ofFinFETtransistors with fin pitches in the 20s of nanometer and densest metal pitches in the 30s of nanometers. Due to the small feature sizes, these processes make extensive use of EUV for the critical dimensions, along with quad patterning for the fins and double patterning for the rest of the metal stack. Note that Intel7 nm processis comparable to the foundry 5-nanometer node.\n\nIn terms of raw cell-level density, the 5-nanometer node features silicon densities between 130-230 milliontransistors per square millimeterbased on WikiChip's own analysis.\n\nOnly three companies are currently planning or developing a 5-nanometer node:Intel,TSMC, andSamsung.\n\n• Transistor gate pitch is also referred to as CPP (contacted poly pitch) and interconnect pitch is also referred to as MMP (minimum metal pitch).\n\nIntel 4process, codenamedP1276, formerlyIntel7-nanometer process, will enter risk production at the end of2022and ramp in2023. On February 82017,Intelannounced a $7B investment in Arizona's Fab 42 which will eventually produce chips on a7 nmprocess. On March 232021, Intel announced a $20B investment for two fabs in Arizona, which will produce chips on a7 nmprocess.\n\nTSMCstarted mass production of its5-nanometer N5 nodein April2020.TSMCconsiders its 5-nanometer node a full node shrink over its7-nanometer process. In early2021TSMCplans on introducing a second version of its N5 process calledN5Pwhich provides additional performance enhancements.\n\nTSMCstarted itsrisk productionof the 5-nanometer,N5, node in March2019. The process ramped in April2020. The N5 process is afull nodesuccessor to the company'sN7 node, featuring 1.84x improvement in logic density.\n\nThe N5 node continues to usebulk siliconFinFET transistors. Leveraging their experience from 7+,5 nmmakes extensive use ofEUVfor more critical layers in order to reduce themulti-patterningcomplexity. It is believed thatTSMCN5 process uses 11-13 EUV masks in order to replace about 35 immersion layers that would otherwise be required to produce the same pattern without EUV. In other words for TSMC to go from itsN7node to itsN5node would entail going from roughly 87masksto 115 masks. The introduction of EUV reduced this number back down to around 81 masks.\n\nAt a high level, TSMC N5 is a high-density high-performanceFinFETprocess designed for mobile SoCs and HPC applications. Fabrication makes extensive use of EUV at Fab 18, the company’s new 12-inch GigaFab located at the Southern Taiwan Science Park. TSMC says that its 5-nanometer process is 1.84x denser than its7-nanometer node. TSMC also optimized analog devices where roughly 1.2x scaling has been achieved. TSMC reported the density for a typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO, their 5 nm technology scaling was projected to reduce chip size by 35%-40%.\n\nIn order to improve the drive current, TSMC introduced ahigh-mobility channel(HMC) for its 5-nanometerFinFET devices. We believe TSMC is employing a SiGe channel for the pMOS devices. It has been suggested that the channel has 37% Ge composition. TSMC says that the HMC delivers 18% performance gain versus equivalent Si finFETs.\n\nDespite aggressively tighter pitches, TSMC says metal lines RC and via resistance have been kept relatively similar to N7. TSMC says this was achieved by \"using EUV patterning, innovative scaled barrier/liner, ESL/ELK dielectrics, and Cu reflow.\" The improvements meant the interconnect RC did not worsen relative to N7 as N7 did relative to N16.\n\nThe 5 nm node is expected to deliver a 15% improvement in performance atconstant poweror a 20% reduction in power atconstant performance. In addition to the ultra-LVT (uLVT) that was offered withN7, there is a new extreme-LVT (eLVT) which can push that 15% up to 25% higher speed at Vdd. Additionally, compared to the standard N5 cells, the HP cell variants can push that performance by another 10% at the cost of density.\n\nThe N5 node makes use of a number ofdensity boostersunder a marketing term called \"smart hyper-scaling features\" (similar to Intel). N5 introducessingle diffusion breaksin order to reduce cell spacing. Additionally, TSMC added the ability to drop the gate contact over the active region (COAG). Although originally experimented with at the N7 node,via pillarsare also used extensively in the N5 node. TSMC makes extensive use ofvia pillarsin N5 due to the three-fold increase of Mx resistance.\n\nTwo6TSRAMbitcellswere disclosed by TSMC. The high-performance cell is 0.025 µm² while the high-density cell is 0.021 µm². Assuming a ballpark assist circuit overhead of around 30%, the high-density cells yields an estimate of ~32 Mib/mm² of cache. This an increase of 30% fromN7which is around 24.7 Mib/mm². At ISSCC 2020, TSMC presented a test shuttle with 135 Mib of HD SRAM and additional IPs. Their reported density for the HD cells is similar to our estimates.\n\nAs with their 7-nanometer process, TSMC offer an optimized version of their N5 process calledN5 Performance-enhanced version(N5P). This process uses the same design rules and is fully IP-compatible with N5. Through FEOL and MOL optimizations, N5P will offer 7% higher performance over N5 atiso-poweror 15% lower power atiso-performance. Risk production for N5P is expected to start around the fourth quarter of 2020 with volume production starting sometimes in 2021.\n\nSamsung5-Nanometer Low-Power Early(5LPE) design development completed in early 2019.

    "content": "Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture semiconductor devices, typically integrated circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, and memories (such as RAM and flash memory). It is a multiple-step photolithographic and physico-chemical process (with steps such as thermal oxidation, thin-film deposition, ion implantation, etching) during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer, typically made of pure single-crystal semiconducting material. Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications. Steps such as etching and photolithography can be used to manufacture other devices, such as LCD and OLED displays.\nThe fabrication process is performed in highly specialized semiconductor fabrication plants, also called foundries or \"fabs\", with the central part being the \"clean room\". In more advanced semiconductor devices, such as modern 14/10/7 nm nodes, fabrication can take up to 15 weeks, with 11–13 weeks being the industry average. Production in advanced fabrication facilities is completely automated, with automated material handling systems taking care of the transport of wafers from machine to machine.\nA wafer often has several integrated circuits, which are called dies as they are pieces diced from a single wafer. Individual dies are separated from a finished wafer in a process called die singulation, also called wafer dicing. The dies can then undergo further assembly and packaging.\nWithin fabrication plants, the wafers are transported inside special sealed plastic boxes called FOUPs. FOUPs in many fabs contain an internal nitrogen atmosphere which helps prevent copper from oxidizing on the wafers. Copper is used in modern semiconductors for wiring. The insides of the processing equipment and FOUPs is kept cleaner than the surrounding air in the cleanroom. This internal atmosphere is known as a mini-environment and helps improve yield, which is the number of working devices on a wafer. This mini environment is within an EFEM (equipment front end module) which allows a machine to receive FOUPs, and introduces wafers from the FOUPs into the machine. Additionally, many machines also handle wafers in clean nitrogen or vacuum environments to reduce contamination and improve process control. Fabrication plants need large amounts of liquid nitrogen to maintain the atmosphere inside production machinery and FOUPs, which are constantly purged with nitrogen. There can also be an air curtain or a mesh between the FOUP and the EFEM which helps reduce the amount of humidity that enters the FOUP and improves yield. \nSome of the companies that manufacture machines used in the industrial semiconductor fabrication process include ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and Lam Research.\n\n",

The rate at which MOS transistor counts have increased generally follows Moore's law, which observes that transistor count doubles approximately every two years. However, being directly proportional to the area of a die, transistor count does not represent how advanced the corresponding manufacturing technology is. A better indication of this is transistor density which is the ratio of a semiconductor's transistor count to its die area.",

A large and well-equipped fighter, the F-14 was the first of the American Teen Series fighters, which were designed incorporating air combat experience against smaller, more maneuverable MiG fighters during the Vietnam War.\nThe F-14 first flew on 21 December 1970 and made its first deployment in 1974 with the U.S. Navy aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, replacing the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The F-14 served as the U.S. Navy's primary maritime air superiority fighter, fleet defense interceptor, and tactical aerial reconnaissance platform into the 2000s. The Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) pod system was added in the 1990s and the Tomcat began performing precision ground-attack missions. The Tomcat was retired by the U.S. Navy on 22 September 2006, supplanted by the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Several retired F-14s have been put on display across the US.\nHaving been exported to Pahlavi Iran under the Western-aligned Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1976, F-14s were used as land-based interceptors by the Imperial Iranian Air Force. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force used them during the Iran–Iraq War.

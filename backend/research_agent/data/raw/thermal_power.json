    "content": "Immersion cooling technology encompasses systems in which electronic components are directly exposed to and interact with dielectric fluids for cooling purposes. This includes systems using single-phase or two-phase dielectric liquids, leveraging their thermal capabilities to manage and dissipate heat generated by electronic components.\nHeat is removed from the system by putting the coolant in direct contact with hot components, and circulating the heated liquid through heat exchangers. This practice is highly effective as liquid coolants can absorb more heat from the system than air. Immersion cooling has many benefits, including but not limited to: sustainability, performance, reliability, and cost.\nThe fluids used in immersion cooling are dielectric liquids to ensure that they can safely come into contact with energized electronic components. Commonly used dielectric liquids in immersion cooling are synthetic hydrocarbons, esters (natural and synthetic) and fluorochemicals.",

    "content": "Computer cooling is required to remove the waste heat produced by computer hardware, to keep components within permissible operating temperature limits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent failure if overheated include integrated circuits such as central processing units (CPUs), chipsets, graphics cards, hard disk drives, and solid state drives (SSDs).\nComponents are often designed to generate as little heat as possible, and computers and operating systems may be designed to reduce power consumption and consequent heating according to workload, but more heat may still be produced than can be removed without attention to cooling. Use of heatsinks cooled by airflow reduces the temperature rise produced by a given amount of heat. Attention to patterns of airflow can prevent the development of hotspots. Computer fans are widely used along with heatsink fans to reduce temperature by actively exhausting hot air. There are also other cooling techniques, such as liquid cooling. All modern day processors are designed to cut out or reduce their voltage or clock speed if the internal temperature of the processor exceeds a specified limit. This is generally known as Thermal Throttling in the case of reduction of clock speeds, or Thermal Shutdown in the case of a complete shutdown of the device or system.\nCooling may be designed to reduce the ambient temperature within the case of a computer, such as by exhausting hot air, or to cool a single component or small area (spot cooling). Components commonly individually cooled include the CPU, graphics processing unit (GPU) and the northbridge.\n\n",

Graphics processing units are known to have even larger discrepancies between peak and TDP.",

    "content": "A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.\nSince IT operations are crucial for business continuity, a data center generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply, data communication connections, environmental controls (e.g., cooling, fire suppression), and various security devices. Data centers are the foundation of the digital infrastructure that powers the modern economy, aggregating collective computing demands for cloud services, video streaming, blockchain and crypto mining, machine learning, and virtual reality. Large data centers operate at an industrial scale, requiring significant energy. Estimated global data center electricity consumption in 2024 was around 415 terawatt hours (TWh), or about 1.5% of global electricity demand. The IEA projects that data center electricity consumption could double by 2030. High demand, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning workloads is accelerating the deployment of high-performance servers, leading to greater power density and increased strain on electric grids.\nData centers can vary widely in terms of size, power requirements, redundancy, and overall structure. Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers, colocation facilities, hyperscale data centers, and edge data centers. In particular, colocation centers often host private peering connections between their customers, internet transit providers, cloud providers, meet-me rooms for connecting customers together Internet exchange points, and landing points and terminal equipment for fiber optic submarine communication cables, which are critical to connecting the internet.\n\n",

    "content": "Power integrity or PI involves a series of electronic engineering efforts aimed at ensuring that power supply subsystems adequately support the performance of an entire electronic system.\nPI engineering focuses on designing and evaluating power supply subsystems to prevent any degradation in system performance due to potential adverse effects from the power supplies. For instance, a noisy power supply can cause audible or visible disturbances or slow down data communication. PI engineering employs various methods to minimize or eliminate such noise. The effectiveness of PI engineering is measured by the overall system performance, even though it specifically addresses power supply circuits. In other words, PI engineering identifies circuit blocks that are sensitive to power supply perturbations and requires careful attention.\nPI is essential for achieving successful signal integrity (SI) engineering, which deals with impedance matching among multiple elements. Like SI, PI also ensures proper connections between a power supply and a load device, which is often a concern for SI. This connection path is known as a power delivery network (PDN), and tuning the PDN path from the power source to load devices is referred to as PDN impedance design.",

It is a type of photolithography that uses 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from a laser-pulsed tin (Sn) plasma to create intricate patterns on semiconductor substrates. \nAs of 2025, ASML Holding is the only company that produces and sells EUV systems for chip production, targeting 5 nanometer (nm) and 3 nm process nodes, though Reuters reported in December 2025 that China had developed its own prototype EUV system.\nThe EUV wavelengths that are used in EUVL are near 13.5 nanometers (nm), using a laser-pulsed tin (Sn) droplet plasma to produce a pattern by using a reflective photomask to expose a substrate covered by photoresist.  Tin ions in the ionic states from Sn IX to Sn XIV give photon emission spectral peaks around 13.5 nm from 4p64dn – 4p54dn+1 + 4dn−14f ionic state transitions.\n\n",

    "content": "A heat pump is a device that uses mechanical or thermal energy to transfer heat from one space to another. The mechanical heat pump, also known as a Cullen engine, uses electric power to transfer heat by compression. Specifically, it transfers thermal energy by means of a heat pump and refrigeration cycle, cooling one space and warming the other. Heat pumps driven by thermal energy are known as absorption heat pumps.\nIn winter, a heat pump can move heat from the cool outdoors to warm a house; in summer, it may also be designed to move heat from the house to the warmer outdoors. As it transfers rather than generates heat, it is more energy-efficient than heating by gas boiler. \nIn a typical vapor-compression heat pump, a gaseous refrigerant is compressed so its pressure and temperature rise. When the pump operates as a heater in cold weather, the warmed gas flows to a heat exchanger in the indoor space, where some of its thermal energy is transferred to that space, causing the gas to condense into a liquid. The liquified refrigerant flows to a heat exchanger in the outdoor space, where the pressure falls, the liquid evaporates, and the temperature of the gas falls. Now colder than the temperature of the outdoor space being used as a heat source, it can again take up energy from the heat source, be compressed, and repeat the cycle.\nAir source heat pumps are the most common models, while other types include ground source heat pumps, water source heat pumps, and exhaust air heat pumps. Large-scale heat pumps are also used in district heating systems.\nBecause of their high efficiency and the increasing share of fossil-free sources in electrical grids, heat pumps are playing a role in climate change mitigation. At a cost of 1 kWh of electricity, they can transfer 1 to 4.5 kWh of thermal energy into a building. The carbon footprint of heat pumps depends on how electricity is generated, but they usually reduce emissions. Heat pumps could satisfy over 80% of global space and water heating needs with a lower carbon footprint than gas-fired condensing boilers: however, in 2021 they only met 10%, the boycott of Russian natural gas has accelerated the need to shift toward alternative, 3 million European heat pumps were sold in 2023. Although sales have grown significantly, adoption remains limited. In 2025, REPowerEU provides a clear roadmap to transition to this high efficient and flexible air conditioning system.",

    "content": "Refrigerants are  working fluids that carry heat from a cold environment to a warm environment while circulating between them. For example, the refrigerant in an  air conditioner carries heat from a cool indoor environment to a hotter outdoor environment. Similarly, the refrigerant in a kitchen refrigerator carries heat from the inside the refrigerator out to the surrounding room. A wide range of fluids are used as refrigerants, with the specific choice depending on the temperature range needed and constraints related to the system involved.\nRefrigerants are the basis of vapor compression refrigeration systems. The refrigerant is circulated in a loop between the cold and warm environments (see figure). In the low-temperature environment, the refrigerant absorbs heat at low pressure, causing it to evaporate. The gaseous refrigerant then enters a compressor, which raises its pressure and temperature. The pressurized refrigerant circulates through the warm environment, where it releases heat and condenses to liquid form. The high-pressure liquid is then depressurized and returned to the cold environment as a liquid-vapor mixture.\n\n \nRefrigerants are also used in  heat pumps, which work like refrigeration systems. In the winter, a heat pump absorbs heat from the cold outdoor environment and releases it into the warm indoor environment. In summer, the direction of heat transfer is reversed.\nRefrigerants include naturally occurring fluids, such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, propane, or isobutane, and synthetic fluids, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or hydrofluorocarbons. Many older synthetic refrigerants have been banned to protect the Earth's ozone layer or to limit climate change. Some refrigerants are flammable or toxic, making careful handling and disposal essential.\nRefrigerants, while strongly associated with vapor compression systems, are used for many other purposes. These applications include  propelling aerosols, polymer foam production, chemical feedstocks, fire suppression, and solvents.\nChillers are refrigeration systems that have a secondary loop which circulates a   refrigerating liquid (as opposed to a refrigerant), with vapor compression refrigeration used to chill the secondary liquid.  Absorption refrigeration systems operate by absorbing a gas, such as ammonia, into a liquid, such as water.\n\n",

    "content": "A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems.\nSince IT operations are crucial for business continuity, a data center generally includes redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power supply, data communication connections, environmental controls (e.g., cooling, fire suppression), and various security devices. Data centers are the foundation of the digital infrastructure that powers the modern economy, aggregating collective computing demands for cloud services, video streaming, blockchain and crypto mining, machine learning, and virtual reality. Large data centers operate at an industrial scale, requiring significant energy. Estimated global data center electricity consumption in 2024 was around 415 terawatt hours (TWh), or about 1.5% of global electricity demand. The IEA projects that data center electricity consumption could double by 2030. High demand, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning workloads is accelerating the deployment of high-performance servers, leading to greater power density and increased strain on electric grids.\nData centers can vary widely in terms of size, power requirements, redundancy, and overall structure. Four common categories used to segment types of data centers are onsite data centers, colocation facilities, hyperscale data centers, and edge data centers. In particular, colocation centers often host private peering connections between their customers, internet transit providers, cloud providers, meet-me rooms for connecting customers together Internet exchange points, and landing points and terminal equipment for fiber optic submarine communication cables, which are critical to connecting the internet.\n\n",

    "content": "Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. More broadly, it refers to any design that pushes computation physically closer to a user, so as to reduce the latency compared to when an application runs on a centralized data center.\nThe term began being used in the 1990s to describe content delivery networks—these were used to deliver website and video content from servers located near users. In the early 2000s, these systems expanded their scope to hosting other applications, leading to early edge computing services. These services could do things like find dealers, manage shopping carts, gather real-time data, and place ads.\nThe Internet of Things (IoT), where devices are connected to the internet, is often linked with edge computing.",

    "content": "Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are technologies that assist drivers with the safe operation of a vehicle. Through a human-machine interface, ADAS increases car and road safety. ADAS uses automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors and respond accordingly. ADAS can enable various levels of autonomous driving.\nAs most road crashes occur due to human error, ADAS are developed to automate, adapt, and enhance vehicle technology for safety and better driving. ADAS is proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error. Safety features are designed to avoid crashes and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems, implementing safeguards, and taking control of the vehicle if necessary. ADAS may provide adaptive cruise control, assist in avoiding collisions, alert drivers to possible obstacles, warn of lane departure, assist in lane centering, incorporate satellite navigation, provide traffic warnings, provide navigational assistance through smartphones, automate lighting, or provide other features. According to the national crash database in the US, forward collision prevention systems have the potential to reduce crashes by 29%. Similarly, lane keeping assistance is shown to offer a reduction potential of 19%, while blind zone detection could decrease crash incidents by 9%.\nAccording to a 2021 research report from Canalys, approximately 33% of new vehicles sold in the United States, Europe, Japan, and China had ADAS. The firm also predicted that 50% of all automobiles on the road by the year 2030 would be ADAS-enabled.\n\n",

    "content": "Generative artificial intelligence, also known as generative AI or GenAI, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to generate new data in response to input, which often takes the form of natural language prompts.\nThe prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Generative AI applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini and Grok; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTX and Sora.\nCompanies in a variety of sectors have used generative AI, including those in software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, and product design.  \nGenerative AI has been used for cybercrime, and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes. Generative AI models have been trained on copyrighted works without the rightholders' permission. Many generative AI systems use large-scale data centers whose environmental impacts include e-waste, consumption of fresh water for cooling, and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily.",

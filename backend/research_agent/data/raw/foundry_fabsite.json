    "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world's largest dedicated contract chipmaker, the largest manufacturer of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and a key supplier of Nvidia, Apple, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. It is one of the world's most valuable semiconductor companies, and Taiwan's largest company, with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although the government of Taiwan is the largest individual shareholder, the majority of TSMC is owned by foreign investors. In 2025, the company was ranked 38th in the Forbes Global 2000. Taiwan's exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, nearly 25 percent of Taiwan's GDP. TSMC constitutes about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main index.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) was established in 1987 as a joint venture between Taiwan’s government, the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), and private investors. Morris Chang founded the company to commercialize semiconductor research originally developed at ITRI, becoming the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive. It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4 percent in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1 percent in earnings.\nMost fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.\nTSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.\n\n",

    "content": "Intel Corporation is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It designs, manufactures, and sells computer components such as central processing units (CPUs) and related products for business and consumer markets. Intel was the world's third-largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue in 2024 and has been included in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue since 2007. It was one of the first companies listed on Nasdaq. Since 2025, Intel is partially owned by the United States government.\nIntel supplies microprocessors for most manufacturers of computer systems, and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). It also manufactures chipsets, network interface controllers, flash memory, graphics processing units (GPUs), and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel has a strong presence in the high-performance general-purpose and gaming PC market with its Intel Core line of CPUs, whose high-end models are among the fastest consumer CPUs, as well as its Intel Arc series of GPUs.\nIntel was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, along with investor Arthur Rock, and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. The company was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center, as well as being an early developer of static (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip—the Intel 4004—in 1971, it was not until the success of the PC in the early 1980s that this became its primary business.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel, known as Wintel, became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape, solidifying Intel's position on the market. As a result, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid-to-late 1990s, fostering the rapid growth of the PC industry. During this period, it became the dominant supplier of microprocessors, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry. Since the 2000s and especially the late 2010s, Intel has faced increasing competition from AMD, which has led to a decline in its dominance and market share in the PC market. Nevertheless, as of 2023, Intel still leads the x86 market by a wide margin.\n\n",

    "content": "In the microelectronics industry, a semiconductor fabrication plant, also called a fab or a foundry, is a factory where integrated circuits (ICs) are manufactured.\nThe cleanroom is where all fabrication takes place and contains the machinery for integrated circuit production such as steppers and/or scanners for photolithography, etching, cleaning, and doping.  All these devices are extremely precise and thus extremely expensive. \nPrices for pieces of equipment for the processing of 300 mm wafers range to upwards of $4,000,000 each with a few pieces of equipment reaching as high as $340,000,000 (e.g. EUV scanners). A typical fab will have several hundred equipment items.\nSemiconductor fabrication requires many expensive devices. Estimates put the cost of building a new fab at over one billion U.S. dollars with values as high as $3–4 billion not being uncommon. For example, TSMC invested $9.3 billion in its Fab15 in Taiwan. The same company estimations suggest that their future fab might cost $20 billion. \nA foundry model emerged in the 1990s: Companies owning fabs that produced their own designs were known as integrated device manufacturers (IDMs). Companies that outsourced manufacturing of their designs were termed fabless semiconductor companies. Those foundries which did not create their own designs were called pure-play semiconductor foundries. \nIn the cleanroom, the environment is controlled to eliminate all dust, since even a single speck can ruin a microcircuit, which has nanoscale features much smaller than dust particles.  The clean room must also be damped against vibration to enable nanometer-scale alignment of photolithography machines and must be kept within narrow bands of temperature and humidity. Vibration control may be achieved by using deep piles in the cleanroom's foundation that anchor the cleanroom to the bedrock, careful selection of the construction site, and/or using vibration dampers. Controlling temperature and humidity is critical for minimizing static electricity. Corona discharge sources can also be used to reduce static electricity.  \nOften, a fab will be constructed in the following manner (from top to bottom): the roof, which may contain air handling equipment that draws, purifies and cools outside air, an air plenum for distributing the air to several floor-mounted fan filter units, which are also part of the cleanroom's ceiling, the cleanroom itself, which may or may not have more than one story, a return air plenum, the clean subfab that may contain support equipment for the machines in the cleanroom such as chemical delivery, purification, recycling and destruction systems, and the ground floor, that may contain electrical equipment. Fabs also often have some office space.",

    "content": "The semiconductor industry is the aggregate of companies engaged in the design and fabrication of semiconductors and semiconductor devices, such as transistors and integrated circuits. Its roots can be traced to the invention of the transistor by Shockley, Brattain, and Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1948.  Bell Labs licensed the technology for $25,000, and soon many companies, including Motorola (1952), Shockley Semiconductor (1955), Sylvania, Centralab, Fairchild Semiconductor and Texas Instruments were making transistors.  In 1958 Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild independently invented the Integrated Circuit, a method of producing multiple transistors on a single \"chip\" of Semiconductor material. This kicked off a number of rapid advances in fabrication technology leading to the exponential growth in semiconductor device production, known as Moore's law that has persisted over the past six or so decades. The industry's annual semiconductor sales revenue has since grown to over $481 billion, as of 2018.\nIn 2010, the semiconductor industry had the highest intensity of Research & Development in the EU and ranked second after Biotechnology in the EU, United States and Japan combined. \nThe semiconductor industry is in turn the driving force behind the wider electronics industry, with annual power electronics sales of £135 billion ($216 billion) as of 2011, annual consumer electronics sales expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2020, tech industry sales expected to reach $5 trillion in 2019, and e-commerce with over $29 trillion in 2017. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices.\nIn 2021, the sales of semiconductors reached a record $555.9 billion, up 26.2%, with sales in China reaching $192.5 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. A record 1.15 trillion semiconductor units were shipped in the calendar year. The semiconductor industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.",

    "content": "TSMC Fab Capacity by Wafer Size: Complete 2025 Production Overview\nThis analysis examines TSMC's 2025 fab capacity data, revealing how the chipmaker positions itself across wafer sizes, technologies, and locations to meet demand while maintaining technological edge.\nJun 08, 2025\n10\n1\n4\nShare\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the global leader in contract chip manufacturing, stands at the heart of the semiconductor industry, powering everything from smartphones to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems. As the company navigates increasing global demand and geopolitical pressures, understanding TSMC’s manufacturing capacity allocation across its various facilities provides crucial insights into both its strategic priorities and the broader semiconductor landscape.\nThis analysis examines TSMC’s fab capacity data from June 2025, revealing how the world’s most important chipmaker is positioning itself across different wafer sizes, process technologies, and geographic locations to meet evolving market demands while maintaining its technological edge.\nThe data in this article is from TrendForce (as of June 2025).\nThe wafer sizes—6, 8, and 12 inches—reflect TSMC’s diverse manufacturing capabilities. The 12-inch wafer fabs, including Fab 12, Fab 14, Fab 15, Fab 18, Fab 20, and Fab 21, are the backbone of advanced production, supporting nodes as small as 3nm and below, which are critical for high-performance computing and AI applications. Fab 12, for instance, boasts a capacity ranging from 135 WSPM in 1Q25 to 132 WSPM in 4Q25F, a slight decline that could signal planned downtime for equipment upgrades or a shift toward newer facilities like Fab 18, which scales from 242 WSPM to 272 WSPM in the same period. This suggests TSMC is strategically reallocating resources to maintain its edge in cutting-edge process technologies, a move likely influenced by competition from rivals like Samsung and Intel.\nThe 8-inch wafer fabs, such as Fab 2, Fab 3/4, Fab 5, Fab 8, Fab 10, and Fab 11, cater to mature and specialty processes, often used for analog chips, power management ICs, and automotive semiconductors. Fab 8’s capacity comes down from 93 WSPM to 90 WSPM, reflecting steady demand, possibly driven by the automotive sector’s increasing reliance on chips for electric vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Fab 11, highlighted in yellow, sees a slight decline from 24 WSPM to 23 WSPM, which may indicate a targeted expansion to support legacy products or a pivot to meet supply chain resilience goals following recent global shortages. The yellow marking could also hint at a strategic investment, potentially backed by government incentives to bolster domestic production amid geopolitical tensions.\nThe 6-inch wafer fab, Fab 22, with its minimal 0 to 1 WSPM, appears largely phased out or reserved for niche applications, aligning with industry trends favoring larger wafers for cost efficiency and higher yields.\nThe summary rows for wafer sizes tell a compelling story: 12-inch equivalent capacity surges from 1,271,389 WSPM in 1Q25 to 1,287,056 WSPM in 4Q25F, underscoring TSMC’s focus on advanced manufacturing. This growth coincides with the rollout of new nodes and the expansion of facilities in Taiwan, the U.S. (e.g., Arizona), and potentially Japan, where TSMC is building fabs to diversify its footprint amid supply chain concerns.\nThe mature fabs, like Fab 10 and Fab 11, show resilience, with Fab 10 decreasing slightly from 105 WSPM in 1Q25 to 104 WSPM in 4Q25F, likely supporting stable demand for older nodes used in industrial and consumer electronics.\nSpecialty fabs, such as Fab 6 and Fab 14, with capacities like 102 WSPM in 1Q25 and 338 WSPM in 1Q25 respectively, are pivotal for advanced packaging and 3D IC technologies, areas where TSMC is investing heavily to meet the needs of AI and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. The new category, led by Fab 20 with a modest 3 WSPM in 1Q25 to 13 WSPM in 4Q25F, represents emerging capacity that could ramp up.\nSeasonal and quarterly trends further illuminate TSMC’s strategy. The slight capacity changes from 2Q25E to 4Q25F in fabs like Fab 18 (263 to 272 WSPM) suggest a ramp-up to meet year-end demand, possibly for holiday electronics or new AI hardware launches. Conversely, stable outputs in fabs like Fab 21 (3 WSPM for 1Q25E to 10 WSPM for 4Q25F) might reflect a cautious approach to new capacity until market conditions solidify. These adjustments align with TSMC’s history of balancing supply with demand, a skill honed through decades of serving clients like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.\nBeyond the numbers, TSMC’s capacity growth reflects broader industry dynamics. The semiconductor shortage of 2021-2022, exacerbated by pandemic disruptions and geopolitical risks, has pushed TSMC to expand aggressively. Its partnerships with governments, including the U.S. CHIPS Act and Taiwan’s subsidies, are likely fueling investments in new and existing fabs. Moreover, the rise of AI and 5G technologies, which demand advanced nodes and high-volume production, positions TSMC to capitalize on these trends. The data also hints at potential challenges, such as workforce scaling and energy demands, which TSMC must address to sustain this growth.\nIn conclusion, TSMC’s fab capacity data paints a picture of a company at the forefront of semiconductor innovation, with a clear tilt toward 12-inch wafer production and a strategic mix of mature, specialty, and new facilities. The gradual capacity increases and facility-specific trends suggest a well-orchestrated plan to meet rising global demand while navigating supply chain complexities.\nThanks for reading!

Thanks to incredibly high demand for these wafers, the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing giant’s two facilities are completely booked for the entirety of 2026, with output slated to reach an impressive 100,000 monthly units next year.\nPilot production of 2nm wafers is currently underway, with mass production reportedly kicking off by the end of 2025\nThe two 2nm production plants located in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung are yet to commence full-scale production, at least, according to\nDan Nystedt\n, who states that both facilities are currently in the pilot manufacturing stages. The yields are said to be at 70 percent, which is puzzling to learn because TSMC’s trial production run that we talked about last year\nachieved a similar milestone\n.\nRelated Story\nNVIDIA CEO Pushes Back on “Shift” Narrative, Saying the U.S. Chip Production Target Requires TSMC to Add More Capacity, Rather Than Abandoning Taiwan\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo has commented that TSMC’s 2nm yield would be\nhigher than the figure achieved during the trial production run\n, but according to the latest update, it remains at 70 percent. Also, the United Daily News report shared by Dan makes no mention of the 100,000 monthly output that would be achieved during mid-2026, but he states in his thread on X that TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity is also fully booked and can reach 150,000 monthly wafers next year.\nTSMC is in the pilot production and validation phase of its 2nm process in two Taiwan locations, Fab 20 in Hsinchu (BaoShan) and Fab 22 in Kaohsiung, media report, with the yield rate nearly at 70%. Mass production is expected by year-end, with output increasing by mid-2026.…\n— Dan Nystedt (@dnystedt)\nOctober 13, 2025\nThe report does not mention which TSMC customer has placed the biggest order, but we previously mentioned that Apple had\nsecured more than half of the initial 2nm capacity\nto keep rivals like Qualcomm and MediaTek at bay. The first iteration of TSMC’s cutting-edge lithography is being referred to as N2, which will be followed by N2P. The price of each wafer is estimated to be a whopping $30,000.\nThis figure might appear pricey, but TSMC’s customers will quickly learn that it is a bargain because the manufacturer is reported to raise the prices of its 3nm ‘N3E’ and 3nm ‘N3P’ technologies to\n$25,000 and $27,000, respectively\n.\nNews Source:\nUnited Daily News\nFollow\nWccftech on Google\nto get more of our news coverage in your feeds.\nFurther Reading\n“TSMC Is the De Facto Brake on the AI Buildout”, as Analyst Claims the Foundry’s Delay in CapEx Increase Could Cost Hyperscalers Billions in Revenue\nTSMC Rumored To Remove Apple’s Priority Shipment Status From Their Partnership, As iPhone Maker No Longer The Biggest Revenue Contributor To Its Foundry Partner\nApple, Qualcomm & MediaTek Now Focusing On Architectural Refinements, Expanded Memory Cache For Their 2nm SoCs As Cutting-Edge Lithography No Longer Influencing Consumers\nApple iPhone 18: TSMC’s WMCM Packaging Capacity Gives The Strongest Hint Yet About Apple’s Future iPhone Plans\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\nRead all comments on TSMC’s 2nm Capacity Completely Sold Out At Two Local Plants For 2026, Production Output Target At 100,000 Monthly Wafers By Next Year\nTrending Stories\nFinding It Difficult To Get RAM For Your Ryzen 9850X3D Build?

Following its Q4 2025 earnings report, Samsung confirmed that its performance-optimized 2nm node, known as SF2P, has successfully hit the 70% yield threshold required for stable mass production—a feat that many industry skeptics thought would take years to master.\nThis development is more than just a technical victory; it is a strategic lifeline for the world’s largest chip designers. With TSMC’s 2nm capacity currently overwhelmed by exclusive orders from high-priority clients, the emergence of a viable, high-yield alternative from Samsung provides a release valve for a supply chain that has been dangerously bottlenecked. By mastering the intricate Gate-All-Around (GAA) architecture ahead of its rivals, Samsung is positioning itself as the primary destination for the next generation of high-performance AI and mobile processors.\nEngineering the Future: The Maturity of 3rd-Gen GAA\nThe SF2P node represents the second generation of Samsung’s 2nm platform, specifically optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) and premium mobile devices. Unlike traditional FinFET transistors, which hit physical scaling limits years ago, Samsung’s 2nm utilizes its proprietary Multi-Bridge Channel FET (MBCFET) architecture—a 3rd-generation evolution of GAA technology. This approach allows for a \"nanosheet\" design where the width of the channel can be adjusted to optimize for either extreme power efficiency or maximum performance. Compared to the first-generation SF2 node, the 2026-era SF2P delivers a 12% boost in clock speeds, a 25% improvement in power efficiency, and an 8% reduction in total die area.\nTechnical experts note that Samsung’s early gamble on GAA—which it first introduced at the 3nm node while TSMC stuck with FinFET—is finally paying dividends. While competitors are only now navigating the \"learning curve\" of nanosheet production, Samsung has accumulated four years of telemetry data on GAA manufacturing. This experience has allowed the foundry to refine its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography processes and address the \"stochastic\" defects that typically plague sub-3nm nodes. The result is a more uniform transistor structure that significantly reduces leakage current, a critical requirement for the power-hungry AI workloads of 2026.\nA Strategic Pivot: Qualcomm and AMD Secure Capacity\nThe immediate beneficiaries of Samsung’s yield breakthrough are\nQualcomm (\nNASDAQ: QCOM\n)\nand\nAMD (\nNASDAQ: AMD\n)\n. As of late January 2026, both companies are reportedly in final negotiations to shift significant portions of their 2nm roadmap to Samsung Foundry. The move is driven by a stark reality: TSMC’s 2nm (N2) capacity is nearly 50% reserved by a single customer, leaving other tech giants fighting for leftovers and paying a \"wafer premium\" that has risen 50% over previous generations. Qualcomm is expected to utilize SF2P for its next-generation Snapdragon series, while AMD is eyeing the node for its \"Venice\" EPYC server CPUs to ensure supply stability in the face of skyrocketing enterprise demand.\nThis shift represents a significant competitive disruption. For years, TSMC’s \"foundry-only\" model gave it a reputation for neutrality and reliability that Samsung, a conglomerate that also makes its own consumer products, struggled to match. However, the sheer scale of the AI boom has forced a \"dual-sourcing\" strategy among major chip designers. By offering competitive yields and more favorable pricing than TSMC, Samsung is transforming the foundry market from a monopoly into a true duopoly. Furthermore, Samsung’s massive\n$16.5 billion contract with Tesla (\nNASDAQ: TSLA\n)\nfor its AI6 autonomous driving chips has served as a powerful \"seal of approval,\" encouraging other automotive and data center players to reconsider their reliance on a single supplier.\nThe \"One-Stop\" AI Solution and the Taylor, Texas Factor\nSamsung’s 2nm success is part of a broader \"total solution\" strategy that integrates logic, memory, and packaging. In January 2026, Samsung began large-scale shipments of its 12-layer HBM4 (High Bandwidth Memory), a key component for AI accelerators used by\nNVIDIA (\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n)\nand others. By offering 2nm logic manufacturing alongside HBM4 and advanced X-Cube 3D packaging, Samsung provides a vertically integrated stack that reduces latency and power consumption. This \"one-stop shop\" capability is something neither TSMC nor\nIntel (\nNASDAQ: INTC\n)\ncan currently match with the same level of internal synchronization, making Samsung an attractive partner for startups building custom \"Agentic AI\" silicon.\nThe geopolitical dimension of this ramp-up cannot be ignored. Samsung’s Taylor, Texas facility is now 93% complete and is transitioning to a \"2nm-first\" factory. With trial runs of ASML EUV lithography tools scheduled for March 2026, the Taylor fab is set to become a cornerstone of the \"Made in USA\" advanced chip initiative. This domestic capacity is a major selling point for U.S.-based companies like AMD and Google, who are under increasing pressure to diversify their manufacturing away from the geopolitical sensitivities of the Taiwan Strait. Samsung’s ability to hit 70% yield in its Korean facilities provides the blueprint for a rapid and successful ramp in the United States.\nLooking Ahead: The Road to 1.4nm and Backside Power\nWhile the industry focuses on the SF2P ramp, Samsung’s R&D teams are already moving toward the next frontier. Near-term developments include the introduction of SF2Z in 2027, which will incorporate Backside Power Delivery Network (BSPDN) technology. This innovation moves the power circuitry to the back of the wafer, freeing up the top side for more transistors and further reducing voltage drops. Beyond 2nm, the roadmap points toward the 1.4nm (SF1.4) node, where Samsung expects to apply lessons from its GAA maturity to achieve even more aggressive density gains.\nThe challenge remains in maintaining these yields as the volume scales to hundreds of thousands of wafers per month. Experts predict that the next 12 months will be a \"volume war\" as Samsung attempts to match the total output capacity of TSMC’s sprawling \"GigaFabs.\" Additionally, as AI models move from data centers to \"on-device\" edge environments, the demand for SF2P-class chips will expand into a wider variety of form factors, including wearable AR glasses and advanced robotics. The primary hurdle will be the continued availability of high-NA EUV tools and the specialized gases required for sub-2nm etching.\nA New Era for the Semiconductor Industry\nSamsung’s achievement of 70% yield on the SF2P node marks a historic comeback for the South Korean giant. After years of trailing TSMC in the transition from 7nm to 5nm and 4nm, Samsung has utilized the radical architecture shift of Gate-All-Around to leapfrog its competition in terms of manufacturing maturity. This development effectively breaks the \"TSMC bottleneck,\" providing the global AI industry with the diversified supply chain it desperately needs to sustain its current pace of innovation.\nIn the coming weeks, the industry will be watching for the official \"tape-out\" announcements from Qualcomm and AMD, which will confirm the first commercial products to use this new technology. The successful integration of SF2P into the global supply chain will not only redefin",

A combination of soaring artificial-intelligence compute needs at sub-5 nm, sustained demand for mature-node automotive chips, and intensive government incentives is widening both the technology and geographic footprint of the sector. Advanced packaging, especially chiplets and 3-D ICs, has become a parallel revenue engine, while water stewardship, export-control compliance, and EUV-tool talent shortages temper near-term capacity additions. Intensifying geopolitical competition is prompting North America, Europe, and India to localize fabrication, gradually diffusing Asia-Pacific’s traditional production dominance without dislodging its leadership. Competitive dynamics now hinge on node leadership below 5 nm, cost-efficient 28 nm capacity, and foundry-as-a-service offerings targeting start-ups.\nKey Report Takeaways\nBy technology node, the 28 nm segment led with 59.45% of semiconductor foundry market share in 2025; nodes below 10 nm are expanding at a 9.05% CAGR through 2031.\nBy wafer size, 300 mm substrates commanded 68.10% of the semiconductor foundry market size in 2025 and are growing at 9.42% CAGR to 2031.\nBy business model, pure-play foundries controlled 78.85% of 2025 revenue, while IDM foundry services are the fastest-growing at 8.72% CAGR.\nBy application, consumer electronics generated 70.95% of 2025 demand; automotive chips are advancing at 8.55% CAGR through 2031.\nBy geography, Asia-Pacific held 22.65% revenue in 2025 and records the quickest regional expansion at 8.44% CAGR to 2031.\nNote:  Market size and forecast figures in this report are generated using Mordor Intelligence’s proprietary estimation framework, updated with the latest available data and insights as of January 2026.\nGlobal Semiconductor Foundry Market Trends and Insights\nDrivers Impact Analysis\nDriver\n(~)% Impact on CAGR Forecast\nGeographic Relevance\nImpact Timeline\nMainstream chip demand from automotive electrification\n+1.8%\nGlobal, with concentration in Germany, Japan, China\nMedium term (2-4 years)\nIoT-edge proliferation requiring mature‐node\ncapacity\n+1.2%\nAPAC core, spill-over to North America\nShort term (≤ 2 years)\nAI accelerator race for <5 nm advanced nodes\n+0.9%\nTaiwan, South Korea, with expansion to US\nLong term (≥ 4 years)\nChiplets + 3D IC needing new foundry workflows\n+0.7%\nGlobal, led by Taiwan and US innovation hubs\nMedium term (2-4 years)\nDefense agencies' push for trusted domestic fabs\n+0.6%\nUS, EU, with emerging initiatives in India\nLong term (≥ 4 years)\nFoundry-as-a-Service model for start-ups\n+0.5%\nSilicon Valley, with expansion to global tech hubs\nShort term (≤ 2 years)\nSource: Mordor Intelligence\nAI Accelerator Race for Less than 5 nm Advanced Nodes\nSub-5 nm capacity has moved from niche to mainstream as hyperscalers and chip designers race to train larger AI models. TSMC reported that 7 nm and finer nodes contributed 74% of wafer revenue in Q2 2025, underscoring the premium customers place on density leadership\n[1]\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, “TSMC Reports Second Quarter EPS of NTD 15.36,” pr.tsmc.com\n. Samsung’s gate-all-around 2 nm program and Intel’s 1.4 nm roadmap confirm an industry-wide pivot toward atomic-scale geometries. Rapid node migration is also fueling demand for advanced interposers, necessitating co-optimized fab and packaging lines. High capital intensity—often above USD 20 billion per fab—limits viable competitors and cements an oligopolistic market where process leadership directly dictates share.\nMainstream Chip Demand from Automotive Electrification\nElectric vehicles require dual-track silicon: power-management ICs at mature nodes and high-compute SoCs at leading nodes. Automakers’ shift to centralized electronic architectures locks in long-term 28 nm and 45 nm volumes, providing reliable backfill for fabs otherwise pressured by cyclical smartphone orders. Long qualification cycles and strict AEC-Q100 standards encourage multi-year capacity reservations, improving revenue visibility for foundries that balance mature and advanced nodes. Tesla’s custom chip strategy illustrates how OEMs use dedicated capacity deals to secure supply and differentiate performance.\nDefense Agencies’ Push for Trusted Domestic Fabs\nNational security policy now ranks alongside cost in fab-site decisions. The U.S. CHIPS Act deployed USD 52.7 billion to reshore critical nodes, while the Department of Commerce funded a USD 285 million digital-twin institute to streamline domestic manufacturing scale-up\n[2]\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, “CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute,” nist.gov\n. Europe’s Chips Act and India’s semiconductor mission mirror the model, collectively tilting new capacity announcements toward allied regions. Defense contracts guarantee baseline volumes and impose stringent provenance requirements, favoring foundries with secure, on-shore tool chains.\nChiplets + 3-D IC Needing New Foundry Workflows\nVertical stacking and chip-partitioning let designers mix DRAM, analog, RF, and logic dies for system-level gains that raw scaling can no longer provide. TSMC’s SoIC and Samsung’s X-Cube platforms pull packaging into the critical-path schedule, expanding the traditional foundry revenue envelope. New thermal budgets, TSV design rules, and test regimes create steep learning curves, further differentiating incumbents from latecomers.

    "content": "GlobalFoundries & UMC Eye Merger in Chip Industry Shake-Up\nNews\n,\nTechnology\n|\n7. 4. 2025\n7. 4. 2025\n|\nJan Olšan\nIn recent years, much attention has been on whether Intel can close the gap in cutting-edge chip technologies and become a true rival to TSMC. Samsung on the other hand already competes, the company is also facing mounting challenges, however. But a new challenger may be emerging for the Taiwanese king of silicon lithography: according to reports, GlobalFoundries and UMC may be exploring a merger to create a stronger competitor.\nThese rumors surfaced via Nikkei Asia, which claims that the deal would not be an acquisition of one company by the other but a merger. And it appears this isn’t mere speculation from one party – Nikkei reports that both companies are actively evaluating the pros and cons of the proposed union. While it might seem like an April Fool’s prank given the date the report arrived at (March 31) or one of the many unsubstantiated rumors that often come up, the details suggest this is a genuine negotiation.\nNikkei states it has obtained a document analyzing the plan, likely prepared for internal use by one of the involved parties (most likely GlobalFoundries). This plan, reportedly codenamed “Project Ultron,” aims to create a foundry that could command up to 28% of the global chip manufacturing market.\nUMC has officially denied that any talks are taking place. However, such denials are common in the early stages of negotiations, especially when parties are cautious about creating false expectations should the deal fall through.\nBoth Samsung and Intel are expectedly keen to position themselves as larger rivals to TSMC, but their strategies hinge on the most advanced semiconductor processes. That’s not the case with GlobalFoundries and UMC – these companies specialize in so-called “mature” nodes such as 28nm, 20nm, and 12nm, which are used in more affordable products or applications that don’t benefit from the most advanced nodes (e.g., analog and RF circuits).\nEven if the merger goes through, this core business model likely won’t change (though GlobalFoundries could in theory try to revive its earlier ambitions for a 7nm EUV process). “Ultron” would still focus on older, cost-efficient manufacturing processes. Interestingly, UMC is currently co-developing such a process with Intel. A merger with GlobalFoundries could throw a wrench into that collaboration.\nUMC: 12A Fab in Tainan\nUMC is a Taiwan-based company with a history in foundry business that is comparable in length to TSMC’s. In 2021, it was the third-largest foundry in the world behind TSMC and Samsung. GlobalFoundries, which originated from AMD’s manufacturing spin-off and has head quarters in the U.S. (though it’s owned by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala fund), was the fourth-largest. At the time, UMC and GlobalFoundries held 7.9% and 6.9% of the market, respectively, compared to Samsung’s 8.7% and TSMC’s dominant 59.5%. Last year, both UMC and GlobalFoundries retained around 6% market share, but they’re being closely trailed by China’s SMIC at 5%.\nChina factor could complicate things\nLater this month, GlobalFoundries will welcome a new CEO, Tim Breen (appointed in February), and this merger could represent a strategic move under his leadership. The market for mature and budget-friendly chip technologies is increasingly dominated by aggressive Chinese competitors, putting pressure on both GlobalFoundries and UMC. A merger could be a defensive measure to reinforce their market position..\nHowever, even if both companies agree to merge, the plan could be derailed by antitrust regulators. While it might clear review in the U.S. and Taiwan, China poses a significant risk. The Chinese government has recently used merger approvals (or the lack thereof) as leverage in its trade disputes with the U.S., blocking deals like NXP–Qualcomm and Intel–Tower Semiconductor. Moreover, Beijing likely prefers to give its own domestic players a competitive edge over GlobalFoundries and UMC to strengthening these foreign companies. This political element could be the single biggest obstacle to “Project Ultron.”\nSMIC watching from the sidelines…\nThere is also a potential dark horse in the race to compete with TSMC: China’s SMIC. Once a minor player, trailing behind UMC and GlobalFoundries, SMIC enjoys robust state backing. That support is part of China’s broader push for self-reliance in the semiconductor sector and its ambition to challenge Western, Korean, and Taiwanese dominance.\nSMIC has been growing rapidly, buoyed by increased demand in China due to both government preference and U.S. sanctions on foreign tech. Even before that, it was the only company aside from TSMC, Samsung, and Intel that still pursued cutting-edge processes – albeit with substantial delay after the leaders. UMC and later GlobalFoundries, on the other hand, abandoned such ambitions. Now, that persistence might be paying off: SMIC could be poised to leapfrog its older competitors, which will likely remain focused on legacy and analog chip manufacturing.\nSources:\nNikkei Asia\n,\nTom’s Hardware\nEnglish translation and edit by Jozef Dudáš\n⠀\nContents\nbusiness\nGlobalFoundries\nmanufacturing nodes\nUMC\nRelated articles\nAMD got massive GPU order from OpenAI.

Jim Poulin | Phoenix Business Journal\nPhoenix Business Journal\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to install chipmaking equipment in its second Arizona plant next summer as it prepares for mass production at the fab a year earlier than projected, according to an Asian media report.\nTSMC will begin installing equipment and tools in the third quarter of 2026, paving the way to begin 3-nanometer chip production by 2027,\nNikkei Asia reported,\nciting several sources familiar with the matter.\nTSMC is initially projected to begin production at its second Arizona fab by 2028. The company, however, continues to see strong AI-related demand from customers, prompting its decision to accelerate U.S. chip production and upgrades to its more advanced process technologies, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said\nduring an Oct. 16 earnings call.\nAfter equipment is installed in a chip plant, it can take up to a year to qualify production lines and ramp up output. Even more advanced chip production could take longer as there’s thousands of steps involved and requires extensive work to transfer and verify processes to another plant, Nikkei Asia reported, citing information from semiconductor industry executives.\nA TSMC spokesperson declined to comment on the Nikkei Asia report and instead pointed to Wei’s commentary from the company’s October earnings call, in which he said strong collaboration and support for U.S. customers and government is fueling its capacity expansion in Arizona.\n“We are making tangible progress and executing well to our plan,” Wei said.\nTSMC’s first Arizona fab entered high-volume production in late 2024, using N4 process technology with a\nyield comparable to its Taiwan fab.\nThe company\ncompleted construction of its second fab\n— which will utilize 3-nanometer process technology — in April and\nbroke ground on its third fab\nat its north Phoenix site that same month.\nTSMC’s third fab is expected to utilize 2-nanometer and A16 process technologies, while its fourth fab will utilize N2 and A16 process technologies.

    "content": "Much earlier than expected\n\nTSMC is set to start moving equipment into its Fab 21 phase 2 in Arizona next summer, according toNikkei, which cites sources familiar with the plan. Once the supporting and production tools are installed sometimes in 2027, the company will be able to start mass production of chips using its N3 technology, several quarters ahead of schedule.\n\nTSMC will begin installation of equipment into its Fab 21 phase 2 in Arizona in the third calendar quarter — from July to September — of 2026, with the aim to start production at the facility in calendar 2027, several quarters ahead of theoriginal schedule of 2028, if the report from Nikkei is accurate.\n\nConstruction of TSMC's Fab 21 phase 2 in Arizona was completed this year, according to the company. After the building itself, as well as its mechanical/electrical/plumbing systems, are complete, chipmakers begin to install internal infrastructure like elevators and HVACs. Once this phase is done, chip producers perform environmental qualification, and if everything — temperature, pressure, humidity — is stable, then actual production tools are moved in.\n\nDepending on the tool, its installation and tuning take between hours and days, though high-end DUV and EUV lithography systems take significantly longer to install and tune than other machines at the fab. But in any case, it takes months to install the first group of tools, make them work in concert, and begin small-volume mass production. That said, TSMC has a chance to initiate mass production of chips on its N3 manufacturing technology in Arizona already in 2027, though volumes will be limited.\n\nTSMC began to build its N2/A16-capable Fab 21 phase 3 in Arizona in April, 2025. The company hopes to complete this one as fast as possible to start output of its 2nm and 1.6nm-class chips in America ahead of schedule as well.\n\n\"With the strong collaboration and support from our leading U.S. customers and the U.S. federal, state, and city government, we continue to speed up our capacity expansion in Arizona,\" C.C. Wei, chief executive of TSMC, said at the most recent earnings call in October. \"We are making tangible progress and executing well to our plan. In addition, we are preparing to upgrade our technologies faster to N2 and more advanced process technologies in Arizona, given the strong AI-related demand from our customers.\"\n\nFollowTom's Hardware on Google News, oradd us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.\n\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\n\nAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom’s Hardware.

    "content": "The Silicon Heartland is coming along nicely.\n\nBack in 2022,Intel announced its Ohio One project, originally pitched as America's biggest fab complex at one point. Since then, plans have been scaled back, and the project has faced multiple delays amidst internal shakeups — but it was never abandoned. A few months ago,Intel confirmed that Ohio One is still alive and kickingafter the company was probed by a U.S. Senator. Today, new job listings posted by the site's contractor hint toward the project finally picking up steam.\n\nIntel Ohio One is back! Bechtel posts loads of new jobs over the last few days looking for managers, welders and electricians to work on the New Albany project. 14A is GO!https://t.co/IgjV07lfDK$INTC pic.twitter.com/UbAZZThbpsJanuary 18, 2026\n\nBechtel Group's Manufacturing and Technology unit, the construction firm responsible for building the Ohio One, has put upnew recruitment offers on its website. At least eight of them directly mention New Albany, the city in Licking County serving as the location for Intel's \"Silicon Heartland.\" Clicking on some of these listings reveals a project overview which says Bechtel is designing and building the first phase of Ohio One, spread across 2.5 million square feet, housing \"as much steel as eight Eiffel Towers\".\n\nOhio One will start with two fabs, Mod 1 and Mod 2, but the space can accommodate up to eight in the future. The current timeline indicates that these factories will beup and running by at least 2030-2031, which marks a significant delay from the admittedly generous 2025 estimates set at the time of the original announcement. Mod 1 will be ready for production first, with Mod 2 likely follow in a year. By that point, Intel might've already moved past even itsnext-gen 14A process.\n\nIntel's latestPanther Lake lineup of mobile CPUsis built in the U.S. at its Arizona and Oregon facilities using the company's new 18A node, a major breakthrough for domestic chip manufacturing. But 18A doesn't have big external clients beyond the Blue Team's own needs, something that itdesperately wants to change with 14A. Ever since his appointment, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been rather bearish about the node, but just a few days ago, theexecutive made a sharp reversal in his sentiments.\n\nOhio One had been long prophesied as the birthplace of 14A, but as things stand right now, that window has likely slipped since 14A istipped to be production-ready by 2027. Its derivatives, like 14A-E, will have already become a large part of Intel's portfolio before Ohio One even opens its doors. That being said, the project was always intended as a leading-edge logic campus, so any new processes can be taped out in the future. We don't need to speculate that far ahead; let's stick with the present.\n\nThe White House released $8.9 billion worth of the remaining CHIPS Act funding to Intelin exchange for a 10% stake in the companylast year. Add to that abudding Nvidia partnership worth $5 billion, and we see a revitalized Intel that finally seems competitive again (especially in its Foundry business), accelerating work on Ohio One after years of stagnation. Now, only time will tell exactly who will cut the ribbon at Mod 1 in a few years from now.\n\nFollowTom's Hardware on Google News, oradd us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.\n\nGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.\n\nHassam Nasir is a die-hard hardware enthusiast with years of experience as a tech editor and writer, focusing on detailed CPU comparisons and general hardware news.

    "content": "The Clue Hiding in Intel's Ohio Construction Site That Investors Shouldn't Ignore\nBy\nTimothy Green\n–\nJan 20, 2026 at 9:40AM EST\nKey Points\nHiring is picking up at Intel's long-delayed Ohio fab.\nRecent comments from CEO Lip-Bu Tan suggest greater success in engaging potential customers for the Intel 14A process than for the Intel 18A process.\nThis could indicate that Intel will accelerate the Ohio construction timeline to support the Intel 14A launch.\nNASDAQ\n:\nINTC\nIntel\nMarket Cap\n$232B\nToday's Change\nangle-down\n(\n-4.50\n%) $\n2.19\nCurrent Price\n$\n46.47\nPrice as of\nJanuary 30, 2026 at 4:00 PM\nET\nIntel 14A could be a big deal for Intel.\nIn 2022,\nIntel\n(\nINTC\n4.50%\n)\nannounced a $28 billion investment in two new leading-edge chip factories in Ohio. This investment was part of Intel's plan to become a world-class foundry serving external customers. Originally, chip production was slated to begin in 2025.\nIntel has delayed the Ohio project multiple times as the company struggled to win external foundry customers. When Lip-Bu Tan took over as\nCEO\nin early 2025, it became reasonable to ask whether the fabs would ever be completed. Tan made it clear that the Intel 14A process node, set to launch in 2027, would proceed only if the company could win meaningful external customers. As of now, 2030 is the target date for the first fab in Ohio to begin producing chips.\nImage source: Intel.\nTwo signs that Intel 14A will be a winner\nIntel 18A, the process node that is now ramping in Arizona and used for Intel's\nPanther Lake\nPC\nCPUs\n, got off to a rough start. Intel reportedly struggled with yield problems, and large external customers remain elusive.\nThe situation seems to have improved. An analyst noted earlier this month that yields for Intel 18A are now over 60% and improving, which is good enough to support the Panther Lake launch. The analyst also reiterated that\nApple\nwas likely to use Intel for manufacturing some of its chips on Intel 18A in addition to exploring Intel 14A for future chips.\nWhile Intel 18A may not be the home run Intel needed to prove its foundry strategy was working, at the very least, it appears the node will be successful and profitable in the long run. That leaves Intel 14A as the true proving ground for Intel. The company must win meaningful external customers well ahead of the start of production for its foundry business to succeed.\nTwo recent signs indicate that Intel 14A is on track. First, the construction company building Intel's Ohio fabs recently posted a handful of new jobs related to the construction of the facilities. While some progress has been made over the past three years, this could indicate that construction is ramping up.\nOn its own, the job posting news isn't enough to draw any real conclusions. However, Tan recently made remarks in an Intel News video on X that are the polar opposite of his cautious statements about the Intel 14A process in 2025. \"We are going big time into 14A. Stay tuned, we are going to see a lot of great momentum on the 14A in terms of yields [and] IP portfolio to serve the customer well,\" said Tan.\nThis statement suggests that Intel is confident that it can win significant external customers for the Intel 14A process. Combined with the hiring news, it could also be a sign that Intel is trying to advance the timeline for its Ohio fabs. If chip production doesn't begin until 2030, that's likely too late to support the Intel 14A process.\nIt's certainly possible that Intel could get the first Ohio fab up and running in 2028 or 2029. If the company has a customer for Intel 14A outside its own product divisions, it would likely be for chips launching in that time frame. The\nApple\nrumor suggests the company is considering using Intel 14A for some chips in 2029.\nExpand\nNASDAQ\n:\nINTC\nIntel\nToday's Change\n(\n-4.50\n%) $\n-2.19\nCurrent Price\n$\n46.47\nKey Data Points\nMarket Cap\n$232B\nDay's Range\n$\n45.96\n- $\n49.58\n52wk Range\n$\n17.66\n- $\n54.60\nVolume\n115M\nAvg Vol\n99M\nGross Margin\n34.77\n%\nWhat does this mean for Intel stock?\nIntel is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes. While the company may not have anything to announce related to the foundry just yet, a more aggressive Ohio construction timeline or the disclosure of a major external foundry customer would almost certainly light a fire under the stock.\nIncreasing the likelihood of Intel 14A's success is the chronic shortage of advanced manufacturing capacity at foundry leader\nTSMC\n. That situation isn't going to change anytime soon, so Intel could stand to benefit over the next few years as chip designers scramble to secure capacity.\nTSMC\nrecently\nbumped up its capital spending plans\n, but building new fabs can take years.\nThrough much of 2025, Intel's foundry business appeared to be teetering on the edge of disaster, with no major external customers and problematic yields. The story has become much brighter in 2026, and if the Ohio hiring news and Tan's statements are any indication, Intel could have major foundry announcements coming in the next year. If Intel can remove any doubt surrounding its foundry strategy, the stock could continue to rally as the company taps into soaring demand for\nadvanced chip manufacturing\n.\nRead Next\nJan 31, 2026\n•\nBy\nHarsh Chauhan\nWhere Will Intel Stock Be in 1 Year?\nJan 31, 2026\n•\nBy\nJames Hires\nIs Intel Stock Going to $0?\nJan 30, 2026\n•\nBy\nLeo Sun\nIntel Just Made a Big Bet on ASML's Next-Gen Technology.

(TSMC)\nplans\nto open or equip nine advanced plants in 2025—eight wafer fabs and one chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging line—marking the most aggressive single-year expansion in the company’s history. Senior executives outlined the roadmap during the firm’s 2025 technology symposium, noting that the yearly build rate has tripled since the 2017-2020 average of three fabs per year.\nCapital expenditure will rise accordingly. Management has set a budget of $38 billion to $42 billion for 2025, up from $29.2 billion in 2024 and surpassing the previous $35.2 billion record set in 2022. The figure reflects both the volume of simultaneous projects and the rising price of lithography equipment; every new low-numerical-aperture EUV scanner costs roughly $235 million, while forthcoming high-NA tools are expected to fetch about $380 million each.\nIn Taiwan, TSMC is ramping 2nm production at Fabs 20 and 22 and preparing Fab 25 in Taichung for post-2nm nodes. Kaohsiung is slated for five additional facilities covering 2nm, A16 (1.6nm-class), and even more advanced processes. Overseas, the company has finished construction of the second phase of its Arizona Fab 21, started the third phase, and is outfitting a second plant in Kumamoto, Japan. A new complex in Dresden, Germany (Fab 24) rounds out the list.\nManagement links the surge in investments to persistent demand from high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence. Large AI accelerators occupy more silicon area than mainstream processors, forcing customers to order more wafers per design. The same demand wave has strained advanced packaging, prompting TSMC to forecast an 80 percent compound annual growth rate in CoWoS capacity from 2022 through 2025, well above last year’s 60 percent target.\nWhether the schedule holds will depend on construction milestones, tool deliveries, and customer adoption of next-generation nodes such as N2P and A16. Still, the 2025 blueprint underscores TSMC’s intent to protect its foundry lead by matching increased device demand with an equally increased manufacturing scale.\nSource(s)\nTaipei Times\n(in English)\nRelated Articles\nstatic version\nload dynamic\nLoading Comments\nComment on this article\n⟨\nPrevious article\nXbox Insider program previews UI changes, including pinning games and hiding apps\nNext article\nGlobalWafers boosts U.S. investment to $7.5 billion\n⟩\nPlease share our article, every link counts!\nAdd as a preferred\nsource on Google\nNathan Ali\n- Tech Writer\n- 356 articles published on Notebookcheck\nsince 2024\nI'm a tech geek at heart, and it all started back in middle school.

    "content": "Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a country in East Asia. The main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa, lies between the East and South China Seas in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, with the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the northwest, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. It has an area of 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 square miles), with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanized population is concentrated. The combined territories under ROC control consist of 168 islands in total covering 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 square miles). The largest metropolitan area is formed by Taipei (the capital), New Taipei City, and Keelung. With around 23.9 million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated countries.\nTaiwan has been settled for at least 25,000 years. Ancestors of Taiwanese indigenous peoples settled the island around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, large-scale Han Chinese immigration began under Dutch colonial rule and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning, the first predominantly Han Chinese state in Taiwanese history. The island was annexed in 1683 by the Qing dynasty and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing in 1912 under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, assumed control following the surrender of Japan in World War II. But with the loss of mainland China to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, the government moved to Taiwan in 1949 under the Kuomintang (KMT).\nFrom the early 1960s, Taiwan saw rapid economic growth and industrialization known as the \"Taiwan Miracle\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party state under martial law to a multi-party democracy, with democratically elected presidents beginning in 1996. Taiwan's export-oriented economy is the 21st-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the 20th-largest by PPP measures, with a focus on steel, machinery, electronics, and chemicals manufacturing. Taiwan is a developed country. It is ranked highly in terms of civil liberties, healthcare, and human development.\nThe political and international status of Taiwan is contentious. Despite being a founding member, the ROC no longer represents China as a member of the United Nations after UN members voted in 1971 to recognize the PRC instead. The ROC maintained its claim to be the sole legitimate representative of China and its territory until 1991, when it ceased to regard the Chinese Communist Party as a rebellious group and acknowledged its control over mainland China. Taiwan is claimed by the PRC, which refuses to establish diplomatic relations with countries that recognise the ROC. Taiwan maintains official diplomatic relations with 11 out of 193 UN member states and the Holy See. Many others maintain unofficial diplomatic ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. International organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate on a non-state basis. Domestically, the major political contention is between the Pan-Blue Coalition, which favors eventual Chinese unification under the ROC and promoting a pan-Chinese identity, contrasted with the Pan-Green Coalition, which favors eventual Taiwan independence and promoting a Taiwanese identity; in the 21st century, both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.",

The act authorizes roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States, for which it appropriates $52.7 billion. \nThe act includes $39 billion in subsidies for chip manufacturing on U.S. soil along with 25% investment tax credits for costs of manufacturing equipment, and $13 billion for semiconductor research and workforce training, with the dual aim of strengthening American supply chain resilience and countering China. It also invests $174 billion in the overall ecosystem of public sector research in science and technology, advancing human spaceflight, quantum computing, materials science, biotechnology, experimental physics, research security, social and ethical considerations, workforce development and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at NASA, NSF, DOE, EDA, and NIST.\nThe act does not have an official short title as a whole but is divided into three divisions with their own short titles: Division A is the CHIPS Act of 2022 (where CHIPS stands for the former \"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors\" for America Act); Division B is the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act; and Division C is the Supreme Court Security Funding Act of 2022.\nBy March 2024, analysts estimated that the act incentivized between 25 and 50 separate potential projects, with total projected investments of $160–200 billion and 25,000–45,000 new jobs. However, these projects are faced with delays in receiving grants due to bureaucratic hurdles, shortages of skilled workers, and congressional funding deals that have limited or cut research provisions of the Act by tens of billions of dollars.\n\n",

As of April 2022, he is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand and is the incumbent King of the Ring. Rhodes is also known for co-founding and serving as an executive vice president and wrestler with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) from 2019 until 2022.\nThe son of Dusty Rhodes and half-brother of Dustin Rhodes, Rhodes won two Georgia state high-school championships as an amateur wrestler in 2003 and 2004. He signed with WWE in 2006 and featured for its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won the OVW Television Championship, OVW Southern Tag Team Championship (with Shawn Spears), and OVW Heavyweight Championship once each, becoming a Triple Crown Champion. Between 2007 and 2016, he won seven world tag team championships with four different partners, as well as the Intercontinental Championship twice. During this time, he adopted various gimmicks, including performing as Stardust, a melodramatic spin-off of his brother's gimmick, Goldust. He departed WWE in 2016 and returned in 2022, and has since won the Royal Rumble match in 2023 and 2024, the inaugural WWE Crown Jewel Championship in 2024, the King of the Ring tournament in 2025, the WWE Championship twice, becoming WWE's 34th Triple Crown Champion, and headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, four times (39 – Night 2, 40 – Night 1 & 2, and 41 – Night 2).\nFrom 2016 until 2019, Rhodes wrestled on the independent circuit and for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the mononym Cody, during which he won the ROH World Championship, ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champion (with Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson), and the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship once each. In 2018, Rhodes and the Jacksons independently promoted All In, where he won the NWA World's Heavyweight Championship. All In marked the first event by a promoter outside of WWE or World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to sell 10,000 tickets in the United States since 1993 and directly led to the formation of AEW in early 2019. Between 2019 and 2022, Rhodes served as an executive vice president and also wrestled for AEW, becoming the inaugural and a three-time TNT Champion.  Between WWE, AEW, ROH, NJPW, and NWA, Rhodes has held 19 total championships (including four world titles).\nOutside of wrestling, Rhodes served as a judge on the competition television series Go-Big Show and starred with his wife Brandi Rhodes on the reality television series Rhodes to the Top.",

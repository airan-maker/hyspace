    "content": "The CHIPS and Science Act is a U.S. federal statute enacted by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 9, 2022. The act authorizes roughly $280 billion in new funding to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States, for which it appropriates $52.7 billion. \nThe act includes $39 billion in subsidies for chip manufacturing on U.S. soil along with 25% investment tax credits for costs of manufacturing equipment, and $13 billion for semiconductor research and workforce training, with the dual aim of strengthening American supply chain resilience and countering China. It also invests $174 billion in the overall ecosystem of public sector research in science and technology, advancing human spaceflight, quantum computing, materials science, biotechnology, experimental physics, research security, social and ethical considerations, workforce development and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at NASA, NSF, DOE, EDA, and NIST.\nThe act does not have an official short title as a whole but is divided into three divisions with their own short titles: Division A is the CHIPS Act of 2022 (where CHIPS stands for the former \"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors\" for America Act); Division B is the Research and Development, Competition, and Innovation Act; and Division C is the Supreme Court Security Funding Act of 2022.\nBy March 2024, analysts estimated that the act incentivized between 25 and 50 separate potential projects, with total projected investments of $160–200 billion and 25,000–45,000 new jobs. However, these projects are faced with delays in receiving grants due to bureaucratic hurdles, shortages of skilled workers, and congressional funding deals that have limited or cut research provisions of the Act by tens of billions of dollars.\n\n",

The U.S. maintained embargoes against China from the inception of the People's Republic of China in 1949 until 1972. An embargo was reimposed by the U.S. following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. From 2020 onward, the U.S. imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against several Chinese government officials and companies, in response to the persecution of Uyghurs in China, human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Tibet, military-civil fusion, support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, transnational repression, and fentanyl production.\nEconomic sanctions and export controls against China are administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), respectively.",

    "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) or the Big Beautiful Bill (P.L. 119-21), is a U.S. federal statute passed by the 119th United States Congress containing tax and spending policies that form the core of President Donald Trump's second-term agenda. The bill was signed into law by Trump on July 4, 2025. Although the law is popularly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this official short title was removed from the bill during the Senate amendment process. Therefore, the law officially has no short title.\nThe OBBBA contains hundreds of provisions. It permanently extends the individual tax rates Trump signed into law in 2017, which were set to expire at the end of 2025. It raises the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for taxpayers making less than $500,000, with the cap reverting to $10,000 after five years. The OBBBA includes several tax deductions for tips, overtime pay, auto loans, and creates Trump accounts, allowing parents to create tax-deferred accounts for the benefit of their children, all set to expire in 2028. It includes a permanent $200 increase in the child tax credit, a 1% tax on remittances, and a tax hike on investment income from college endowments. It phases out some clean energy tax credits that were included in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and promotes fossil fuels over renewable energy. It increases a tax credit for advanced semiconductor manufacturing and repeals a tax on silencers. \nIt raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion while making a significant 12% cut to Medicaid spending. The OBBBA expands work requirements for SNAP benefits (formerly called \"food stamps\") recipients and makes states responsible for some costs relating to the food assistance program. The OBBBA includes $150 billion in new defense spending and another $150 billion for border enforcement and deportations. The law increases the funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from $10 billion to more than $100 billion by 2029, making it the single most funded federal law enforcement agency.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the law will increase the budget deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2034 and cause 10.9 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. Further CBO analysis estimated the highest 10% of earners would see incomes rise by 2.7% by 2034 mainly due to tax cuts, while the lowest 10% would see incomes fall by 3.1% mainly due to cuts to programs such as Medicaid and food aid. Several think tanks, experts, and opponents criticized the bill over its regressive tax structure, described many of its policies as gimmicks, and argued the bill would create the largest upward transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in American history, exacerbating inequality among the American population. It has also drawn controversy for rolling back clean energy incentives and increasing funding for immigration enforcement and deportations. According to multiple polls, a majority of Americans oppose the law.\nDemocratic opposition to the health spending cuts included in the OBBBA contributed to the 2025 United States federal government shutdown.",

    "content": "The Japanese semiconductor industry once dominated the world's semiconductor market, with its revenue share reaching 50% in the 1980s. Various explanations have been proposed for this dominance by Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. However, due to a combination of factors, including the shift towards fabless manufacturing in the global semiconductor industry, lack of investment caused by the country's stagnant economy, high wages, an appreciating yen, rapid industrialisation in the rest of Asia, and an agreement with the US to protect the American semiconductor industry, this had dwindled to approximately 10% by 2019.\nThe areas where the country still remains competitive are semiconductor manufacturing equipment (Tokyo Electron (TEL), SCREEN, Advantest), wafers (Shin-Etsu, SUMCO), NAND flash memory (Kioxia, formerly Toshiba Memory), and power semiconductor devices (Renesas, Rohm). Dynamic random-access memory is still developed and manufactured in Japan by the American company Micron, which acquired the Japanese firm Elpida Memory. Since 2021, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has offered large subsidy packages to bring back advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing capabilities to the country. Notable projects backed by this initiative include Rapidus, JASM, and Kioxia's investment in 3D vertical NAND memory factories.",

China has the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP and since 2016 has been the world's largest economy when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). China accounted for 19% of the global economy in 2025 in PPP terms, and around 17% in nominal terms in 2025. The economy consists of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and mixed-ownership enterprises, as well as a large domestic private sector which contribute approximately 60% of the GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs.\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing industrial economy and exporter of goods. China is widely regarded as the \"powerhouse of manufacturing\", \"the factory of the world\" and the world's \"manufacturing superpower\". Its production exceeds that of the nine next largest manufacturers combined. Exports as a percentage of GDP are around 20%. China is the largest trading nation in the world and plays a prominent role in international trade. Manufacturing has been transitioning toward high-tech industries such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, telecommunications and IT equipment, and services has also grown as a percentage of GDP. China is the world's largest high technology exporter. As of 2023, the country spends around 2.6% of GDP to advance research and development across various sectors of the economy. It is also the world's second-largest importer of goods. China is a net importer of services products.\nChina has a network of free trade agreements with several countries, though Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) accounts for the bulk of its trade integration. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 142 are headquartered in China. It has three of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers and three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (both by market capitalization and by trade volume). China has the second-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $17.9 trillion as of 2021. China one of the recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the world as of 2025, receiving inflows of $107 billion. It has the third largest outbound FDI, at US$192.20 billion for 2024. China's economic growth has dealt with a range of challenges in the 2020s including higher youth unemployment and a property crisis.\nWith 773 million workers, the Chinese labor force is the world's largest as of 2024, although it is shrinking due to the rapidly aging population. In March 2025, Forbes estimated China ranked second in the world, after the U.S., in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 516 Chinese billionaires, while Hurun Global Rich List estimated it ranked first, with 1,021 billionaires. China also has 6.3 million millionaires as of 2025, second highest after the U.S. Public social expenditure in China was around 10% of GDP.",

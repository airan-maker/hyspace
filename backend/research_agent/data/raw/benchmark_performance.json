    "content": "Arrow Lake is the codename for Core Ultra Series 2 processors designed by Intel, released on October 24, 2024. It follows on from Meteor Lake which saw Intel move from monolithic silicon to a disaggregated MCM design. Meteor Lake was limited to a mobile release while Arrow Lake includes both socketable desktop processors and mainstream and enthusiast mobile processors. Core Ultra 200H and 200HX series mobile processors followed in early 2025. Arrow Lake desktop CPUs integrated Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 support in the CPU, which allowed it to not be limited by PCIe 3.0 speeds and use simple re-timers instead. The chipset has the same maximum five integrated USB 3.2 2×2, and is Thunderbolt 5 ready if a discrete board is used. The integrated GPU added HDMI 2.1 FRL 48 Gbit/s (also in Meteor Lake) and variable refresh rate (VRR) support. CU-DIMM DDR5 memory support was added and is needed for optimal performance.",

    "content": "CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a proprietary parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerated general-purpose processing, significantly broadening their utility in scientific and high-performance computing. CUDA was created by Nvidia starting in 2004 and was officially released in 2007. When it was first introduced, the name was an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture, but Nvidia later dropped the common use of the acronym and now rarely expands it.\nCUDA is both a software layer that manages data, giving direct access to the GPU and CPU as necessary, and a library of APIs that enable parallel computation for various needs. In addition to drivers and runtime kernels, the CUDA platform includes compilers, libraries and developer tools to help programmers accelerate their applications.\nCUDA is written in the C programming language but is designed to work with a wide array of other programming languages including C++, Fortran, Python and Julia. This accessibility makes it easier for specialists in parallel programming to use GPU resources, in contrast to prior APIs like Direct3D and OpenGL, which require advanced skills in graphics programming. CUDA-powered GPUs also support programming frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenACC and OpenCL.",

    "content": "OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence research organization comprising both a non-profit foundation and a controlled for-profit public benefit corporation (PBC), headquartered in San Francisco, California. It aims to develop \"safe and beneficial\" artificial general intelligence (AGI), which it defines as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work\". OpenAI is widely recognized for its development of the GPT family of large language models, the DALL-E series of text-to-image models, and a text-to-video model named Sora, which have influenced industry research and commercial applications. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has been credited with catalyzing widespread interest in generative AI.\nThe organization was founded in 2015 in Delaware but evolved a complex corporate structure. As of October 2025, following restructuring approved by California and Delaware regulators, the non-profit OpenAI Foundation holds 26% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, with Microsoft holding 27% and employees/other investors holding 47%.  Under its governance arrangements, the OpenAI Foundation holds the authority to appoint the board of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, a mechanism designed to align the entity’s strategic direction with the Foundation’s charter. Microsoft previously invested over $13 billion into OpenAI, and provides Azure cloud computing resources. In October 2025, OpenAI conducted a $6.6 billion share sale that valued the company at $500 billion.\nIn 2023 and 2024, OpenAI faced multiple lawsuits for alleged copyright infringement against authors and media companies whose work was used to train some of OpenAI's products. In November 2023, OpenAI's board removed Sam Altman as CEO, citing a lack of confidence in him, but reinstated him five days later following a reconstruction of the board. Throughout 2024, roughly half of then-employed AI safety researchers left OpenAI, citing the company's prominent role in an industry-wide problem.",

    "content": "Generative artificial intelligence, also known as generative AI or GenAI, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to generate new data in response to input, which often takes the form of natural language prompts.\nThe prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on the transformer architecture. Generative AI applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, Google Gemini and Grok; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo, LTX and Sora.\nCompanies in a variety of sectors have used generative AI, including those in software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, and product design.  \nGenerative AI has been used for cybercrime, and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes. Generative AI models have been trained on copyrighted works without the rightholders' permission. Many generative AI systems use large-scale data centers whose environmental impacts include e-waste, consumption of fresh water for cooling, and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily.",

    "content": "RISC-V (pronounced \"risk-five\") is a free and open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike proprietary ISAs such as x86 and ARM, RISC-V is described as \"free and open\" because its specifications are released under permissive open-source licenses and can be implemented without paying royalties.\nRISC-V was developed in 2010 at the University of California, Berkeley as the fifth generation of RISC processors created at the university since 1981. In 2015, development and maintenance of the standard was transferred to RISC-V International, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland with more than 4,500 members as of 2025.\nRISC-V is a popular architecture for microcontrollers and embedded systems, with development of higher-performance implementations targeting mobile, desktop, and server markets ongoing. The ISA is supported by several major Linux distributions, and companies such as SiFive, Andes Technology, SpacemiT, Synopsys, Alibaba (DAMO Academy), StarFive, Espressif Systems, and Raspberry Pi offer commercial systems on a chip (SoCs) and microcontrollers (MCUs) that incorporate one or more RISC-V compatible processor cores.\n\n",

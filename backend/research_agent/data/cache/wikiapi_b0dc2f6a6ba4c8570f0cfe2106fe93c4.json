It undergoes many microfabrication processes, such as doping, ion implantation, etching, thin-film deposition of various materials, and photolithographic patterning. Finally, the individual microcircuits are separated by wafer dicing and packaged as an integrated circuit.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:18:00.234322"}

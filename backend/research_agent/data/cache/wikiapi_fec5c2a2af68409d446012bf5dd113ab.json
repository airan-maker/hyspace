Electric sparks require a field strength above approximately 4 million V/m in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Similar forms of electric discharge include corona discharge from sharp electrodes, brush discharge from blunt electrodes, etc.\nESD can cause harmful effects of importance in industry, including explosions in gas, fuel vapor and coal dust, as well as failure of solid state electronics components such as integrated circuits. These can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages. Electronics manufacturers therefore establish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to prevent charging, such as avoiding highly charging materials and measures to remove static such as grounding human workers, providing antistatic devices, and controlling humidity.\nESD simulators may be used to test electronic devices, for example with a human body model or a charged device model."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:19:55.163170"}

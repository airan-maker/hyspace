The bill was signed into law by Trump on July 4, 2025. Although the law is popularly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this official short title was removed from the bill during the Senate amendment process. Therefore, the law officially has no short title.\nThe OBBBA contains hundreds of provisions. It permanently extends the individual tax rates Trump signed into law in 2017, which were set to expire at the end of 2025. It raises the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for taxpayers making less than $500,000, with the cap reverting to $10,000 after five years. The OBBBA includes several tax deductions for tips, overtime pay, auto loans, and creates Trump accounts, allowing parents to create tax-deferred accounts for the benefit of their children, all set to expire in 2028. It includes a permanent $200 increase in the child tax credit, a 1% tax on remittances, and a tax hike on investment income from college endowments. It phases out some clean energy tax credits that were included in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and promotes fossil fuels over renewable energy. It increases a tax credit for advanced semiconductor manufacturing and repeals a tax on silencers. \nIt raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion while making a significant 12% cut to Medicaid spending. The OBBBA expands work requirements for SNAP benefits (formerly called \"food stamps\") recipients and makes states responsible for some costs relating to the food assistance program. The OBBBA includes $150 billion in new defense spending and another $150 billion for border enforcement and deportations. The law increases the funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from $10 billion to more than $100 billion by 2029, making it the single most funded federal law enforcement agency.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the law will increase the budget deficit by $2.8 trillion by 2034 and cause 10.9 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. Further CBO analysis estimated the highest 10% of earners would see incomes rise by 2.7% by 2034 mainly due to tax cuts, while the lowest 10% would see incomes fall by 3.1% mainly due to cuts to programs such as Medicaid and food aid. Several think tanks, experts, and opponents criticized the bill over its regressive tax structure, described many of its policies as gimmicks, and argued the bill would create the largest upward transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in American history, exacerbating inequality among the American population. It has also drawn controversy for rolling back clean energy incentives and increasing funding for immigration enforcement and deportations. According to multiple polls, a majority of Americans oppose the law.\nDemocratic opposition to the health spending cuts included in the OBBBA contributed to the 2025 United States federal government shutdown."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:21:12.048869"}

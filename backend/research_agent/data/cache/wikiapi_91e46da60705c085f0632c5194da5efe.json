For example, the refrigerant in an  air conditioner carries heat from a cool indoor environment to a hotter outdoor environment. Similarly, the refrigerant in a kitchen refrigerator carries heat from the inside the refrigerator out to the surrounding room. A wide range of fluids are used as refrigerants, with the specific choice depending on the temperature range needed and constraints related to the system involved.\nRefrigerants are the basis of vapor compression refrigeration systems. The refrigerant is circulated in a loop between the cold and warm environments (see figure). In the low-temperature environment, the refrigerant absorbs heat at low pressure, causing it to evaporate. The gaseous refrigerant then enters a compressor, which raises its pressure and temperature. The pressurized refrigerant circulates through the warm environment, where it releases heat and condenses to liquid form. The high-pressure liquid is then depressurized and returned to the cold environment as a liquid-vapor mixture.\n\n \nRefrigerants are also used in  heat pumps, which work like refrigeration systems. In the winter, a heat pump absorbs heat from the cold outdoor environment and releases it into the warm indoor environment. In summer, the direction of heat transfer is reversed.\nRefrigerants include naturally occurring fluids, such as ammonia, carbon dioxide, propane, or isobutane, and synthetic fluids, such as chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or hydrofluorocarbons. Many older synthetic refrigerants have been banned to protect the Earth's ozone layer or to limit climate change. Some refrigerants are flammable or toxic, making careful handling and disposal essential.\nRefrigerants, while strongly associated with vapor compression systems, are used for many other purposes. These applications include  propelling aerosols, polymer foam production, chemical feedstocks, fire suppression, and solvents.\nChillers are refrigeration systems that have a secondary loop which circulates a   refrigerating liquid (as opposed to a refrigerant), with vapor compression refrigeration used to chill the secondary liquid.  Absorption refrigeration systems operate by absorbing a gas, such as ammonia, into a liquid, such as water.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T07:03:32.772173"}

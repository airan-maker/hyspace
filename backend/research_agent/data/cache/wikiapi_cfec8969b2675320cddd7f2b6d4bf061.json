These devices have been given the generic name \"FinFETs\" because the source/drain region forms fins on the silicon surface. The FinFET devices exhibit significantly faster switching times and higher current density than planar CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology, resulting in enhanced performance and power efficiency.[1]\nFinFET is a type of non-planar transistor, or \"3D\" transistor. It is the basis for modern nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication. Microchips utilizing FinFET gates first became commercialized in the first half of the 2010s, and became the dominant gate design at 14 nm, 10 nm and 7 nm process nodes.\nIt is common for a single FinFET transistor to contain several fins, arranged side by side and all covered by the same gate, that act electrically as one. The number of fins can be varied to adjust drive strength and performance, with drive strength increasing with a higher number of fins."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:15:45.837532"}

The USB Implementers Forum originally announced USB4 in 2019.\nUSB4 enables multiple devices to dynamically share a single high-speed data link. USB4 defines bit rates of 20 Gbit/s, 40 Gbit/s and 80 Gbit/s. USB4 is only defined for USB-C connectors and its Type-C specification regulates the connector, cables and also power delivery features across all uses of USB-C cables, in part with the USB Power Delivery specification.\nThe USB4 standard mandates backward compatibility to USB 3.x and dedicated backward compatibility with USB 2.0. The dynamic sharing of bandwidth of a USB4 connection is achieved by encapsulating multiple virtual connections (\"tunnels\") of other protocols, such as USB 3.x, DisplayPort and PCI Express.\nUSB4 is based on the Thunderbolt 3 protocol. However, it is different enough that backward compatibility to Thunderbolt 3 is optional for many device types.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T14:57:20.269775"}

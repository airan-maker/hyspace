It is commonly used in smartphones, tablet computers, and laptops, where reducing power consumption is important for battery life. For this reason, earlier versions of the technology were also known as Mobile DDR.\nLPDDR differs from standard DDR SDRAM in both design and features, with changes that make it more suitable for mobile devices. Unlike DDR, which is typically installed in removable modules, LPDDR is usually soldered directly onto the device's motherboard to conserve space and improve efficiency. Although LPDDR uses a generational naming convention similar to that of DDR memory (such as LPDDR4 and DDR4), the two follow separate development standards, and the version numbers do not indicate that they share the same technologies. The LPDDR standard is developed and maintained by the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:16:31.936023"}

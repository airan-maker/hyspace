Unlike PCI Express, a device can consist of multiple NVLinks, and devices can use mesh networking to communicate instead of a central hub/switch. The protocol was first announced in March 2014 and uses a proprietary high-speed signaling interconnect (NVHS).\nFor small numbers of GPUs, the NVLink lanes on a single device are sufficient for an all-to-all mesh connectivity. To accommodate higher GPU counts, NVLink since 2018 use a packet-switched architecture, where a central switch can serve up to 32 two-lane ports. The NVSwitch for NVLink 4.0 can produce some simple computation of its own (e.g., sum, broadcast) to reduce the need for communication thanks to the \"SHARP\" accelerator."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T14:57:27.771262"}

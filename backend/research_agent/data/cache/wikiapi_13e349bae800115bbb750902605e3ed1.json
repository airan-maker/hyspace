These foundries are typically, but not exclusively, located in mainland China and Taiwan. Fabless companies can benefit from lower capital costs while concentrating their research and development resources on the end market. Some fabless companies and pure play foundries (like TSMC) may offer integrated-circuit design services to third parties."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:18:46.979299"}

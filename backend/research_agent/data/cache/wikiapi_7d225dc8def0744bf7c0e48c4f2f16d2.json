It follows on from Meteor Lake which saw Intel move from monolithic silicon to a disaggregated MCM design. Meteor Lake was limited to a mobile release while Arrow Lake includes both socketable desktop processors and mainstream and enthusiast mobile processors. Core Ultra 200H and 200HX series mobile processors followed in early 2025. Arrow Lake desktop CPUs integrated Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 support in the CPU, which allowed it to not be limited by PCIe 3.0 speeds and use simple re-timers instead. The chipset has the same maximum five integrated USB 3.2 2×2, and is Thunderbolt 5 ready if a discrete board is used. The integrated GPU added HDMI 2.1 FRL 48 Gbit/s (also in Meteor Lake) and variable refresh rate (VRR) support. CU-DIMM DDR5 memory support was added and is needed for optimal performance."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:19:40.051992"}

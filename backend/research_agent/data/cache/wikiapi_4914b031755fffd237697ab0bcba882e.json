According to the projections contained in the 2021 update of the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a \"2.1 nm node range label\" is expected to have a contacted gate pitch of 45 nanometers and a tightest metal pitch of 20 nanometers. \n\nAs such, 2 nm is used primarily as a marketing term by the semiconductor industry to refer to a new, improved generation of chips in terms of increased transistor density (a higher degree of miniaturization), increased speed, and reduced power consumption compared to the previous 3 nm node generation.\nTSMC began risk production of its 2 nm process in July 2024, with mass production planned for the second half of 2025, and Samsung plans to start production in 2025. Intel initially forecasted production in 2024 but scrapped its 2 nm node in favor of the smaller 18 angstrom (18A) node."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T14:56:45.810492"}

As of April 2022, he is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand and is the incumbent King of the Ring. Rhodes is also known for co-founding and serving as an executive vice president and wrestler with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) from 2019 until 2022.\nThe son of Dusty Rhodes and half-brother of Dustin Rhodes, Rhodes won two Georgia state high-school championships as an amateur wrestler in 2003 and 2004. He signed with WWE in 2006 and featured for its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he won the OVW Television Championship, OVW Southern Tag Team Championship (with Shawn Spears), and OVW Heavyweight Championship once each, becoming a Triple Crown Champion. Between 2007 and 2016, he won seven world tag team championships with four different partners, as well as the Intercontinental Championship twice. During this time, he adopted various gimmicks, including performing as Stardust, a melodramatic spin-off of his brother's gimmick, Goldust. He departed WWE in 2016 and returned in 2022, and has since won the Royal Rumble match in 2023 and 2024, the inaugural WWE Crown Jewel Championship in 2024, the King of the Ring tournament in 2025, the WWE Championship twice, becoming WWE's 34th Triple Crown Champion, and headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, four times (39 – Night 2, 40 – Night 1 & 2, and 41 – Night 2).\nFrom 2016 until 2019, Rhodes wrestled on the independent circuit and for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and Ring of Honor (ROH) under the mononym Cody, during which he won the ROH World Championship, ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champion (with Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson), and the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship once each. In 2018, Rhodes and the Jacksons independently promoted All In, where he won the NWA World's Heavyweight Championship. All In marked the first event by a promoter outside of WWE or World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to sell 10,000 tickets in the United States since 1993 and directly led to the formation of AEW in early 2019. Between 2019 and 2022, Rhodes served as an executive vice president and also wrestled for AEW, becoming the inaugural and a three-time TNT Champion.  Between WWE, AEW, ROH, NJPW, and NWA, Rhodes has held 19 total championships (including four world titles).\nOutside of wrestling, Rhodes served as a judge on the competition television series Go-Big Show and starred with his wife Brandi Rhodes on the reality television series Rhodes to the Top."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T05:18:14.244227"}

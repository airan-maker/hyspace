It is used in conjunction with high-performance graphics accelerators, network devices, high-performance ASICs, as on-package cache or on-package RAM in CPUs, and FPGAs and in some supercomputers (such as the NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA and Fujitsu A64FX). The first HBM memory chip was produced by SK Hynix in 2013, and the first devices to use HBM were the AMD Fiji GPUs in 2015.\nHBM was adopted by JEDEC as an industry standard in October 2013. The second generation, HBM2, was accepted by JEDEC in January 2016. JEDEC officially announced the HBM3 standard on January 27, 2022, and the HBM4 standard in April 2025.\nIn 2025, the world's largest manufacturers of HBM include SK Hynix, Samsung Electronics, and Micron Technology.\nTSMC produces the base die for HBM and is planned to be the foundry for several HBM companies in 2026.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T14:57:01.212784"}

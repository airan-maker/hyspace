It was drafted during the fifth plenum of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held from 26 to 29 October 2020.\nThe 14th Five-Year Plan was drafted against the backdrop of worsening China–United States relations and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused China's economy to shrink in the first quarter of 2020 – the first time in 44 years. Continuing themes from the prior two five-year plans, the 14th Five-Year Plan seeks to boost the services sector, increase urbanization and expand the social safety net to reduce precautionary savings, and also emphasizes high-tech innovation and hard science researches. To address the issue of an aging population, the 14th Five-Year Plan seeks to expand healthcare and retirement system initiatives."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T07:08:39.208196"}

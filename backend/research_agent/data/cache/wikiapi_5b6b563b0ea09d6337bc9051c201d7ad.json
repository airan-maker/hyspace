Various explanations have been proposed for this dominance by Japanese semiconductor manufacturers. However, due to a combination of factors, including the shift towards fabless manufacturing in the global semiconductor industry, lack of investment caused by the country's stagnant economy, high wages, an appreciating yen, rapid industrialisation in the rest of Asia, and an agreement with the US to protect the American semiconductor industry, this had dwindled to approximately 10% by 2019.\nThe areas where the country still remains competitive are semiconductor manufacturing equipment (Tokyo Electron (TEL), SCREEN, Advantest), wafers (Shin-Etsu, SUMCO), NAND flash memory (Kioxia, formerly Toshiba Memory), and power semiconductor devices (Renesas, Rohm). Dynamic random-access memory is still developed and manufactured in Japan by the American company Micron, which acquired the Japanese firm Elpida Memory. Since 2021, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has offered large subsidy packages to bring back advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing capabilities to the country. Notable projects backed by this initiative include Rapidus, JASM, and Kioxia's investment in 3D vertical NAND memory factories."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:21:16.543336"}

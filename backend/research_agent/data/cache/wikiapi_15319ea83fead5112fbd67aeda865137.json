Unlike the 2020–2023 global chip shortage, which stemmed primarily from pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, this shortage is driven by a structural reallocation of manufacturing capacity toward high-margin products for artificial intelligence infrastructure, creating scarcity in consumer and enterprise PC markets.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:18:18.411216"}

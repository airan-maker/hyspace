It shares the same name as its predecessor that was discontinued three years prior to the release of this one.\nIntroduced in March 2015, it was more compact than any other notebook in the MacBook family at the time and included a Retina display, fanless design, and a Butterfly keyboard with lower key travel. It only had a single USB-C port, used for both power and data. It was revised in 2017, and discontinued in July 2019, a year after the release of the MacBook Air with Retina display."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T05:27:36.694091"}

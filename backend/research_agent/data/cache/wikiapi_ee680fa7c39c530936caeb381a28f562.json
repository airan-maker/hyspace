The effect is important in applications where high direct current densities are used, such as in microelectronics and related structures. As the structure size in electronics such as integrated circuits (ICs) decreases, the practical significance of this effect increases.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:19:53.864984"}

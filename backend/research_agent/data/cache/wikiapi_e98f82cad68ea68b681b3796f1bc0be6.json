Components meeting these specifications are suitable for use in the harsh automotive environment without additional component-level qualification testing. The technical documents developed by the AEC Component Technical Committee are available at the AEC web site.\nMost commonly referenced AEC documents are:\n\nAEC-Q100  \"Failure Mechanism Based Stress Test Qualification For Integrated Circuits\"\nAEC-Q101  \"Failure Mechanism Based Stress Test Qualification For Discrete Semiconductors\"\nAEC-Q200  \"Stress Test Qualification For Passive Components\""}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:20:18.058119"}

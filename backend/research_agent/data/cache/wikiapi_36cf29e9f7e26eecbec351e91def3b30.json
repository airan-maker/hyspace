It creates semiconductors, software and services related to wireless technology. It owns patents critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA mobile communications standards.\nQualcomm was established in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs and six others. Its early research into code-division multiple access (CDMA) wireless cell phone technology was funded by selling a two-way mobile digital satellite communications system known as Omnitracs. After a heated debate in the wireless industry, CDMA was adopted as a 2G standard in North America, with Qualcomm's patents incorporated. Afterwards, there was a series of legal disputes about pricing for licensing patents required by the standard.\nOver the years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:19:03.590119"}

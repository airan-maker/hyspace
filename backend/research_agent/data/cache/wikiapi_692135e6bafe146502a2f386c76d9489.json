The company is also working on self-driving technology. \nIn addition, Here provides platform services to computers and smartphones through the Here WeGo app (formerly Nokia/Ovi Maps). As of 2013 it has maps of about 200 countries, offers voice guided navigation, provides live traffic information, and has indoor maps available for about 49,000 unique buildings in 45 countries.

Maps, and the Samsung Gear S2 (and earlier models) mapping app.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:20:41.357734"}

The company was based in Silicon Valley, with headquarters at 1109 McKay Drive in San Jose.  Along with LSI Logic, VLSI Technology defined the leading edge of the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) business, which accelerated the push of powerful embedded systems into affordable products.\nInitially the company often referred to itself as \"VTI\" (for VLSI Technology Inc.), and adopted a distinctive \"VTI\" logo. But it was forced to drop that designation in the mid-1980s because of a trademark conflict. \nVLSI was acquired in June 1999, for about $1 billion, by Philips Electronics and is today a part of the Philips spin-off NXP Semiconductors."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T05:38:31.463929"}

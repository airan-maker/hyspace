The term \"hot\" refers to the effective temperature used to model carrier density,  not to the overall temperature of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the gate dielectric of a MOS transistor, the switching characteristics of the transistor can be permanently changed.  Hot-carrier injection is one of the mechanisms that adversely affects the reliability of semiconductors of solid-state devices."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:20:15.039887"}

The tools work together in a design flow that chip designers use to design and analyze entire semiconductor chips. Since a modern semiconductor chip can have billions of components, EDA tools are essential for their design. A complete set of technologies are integrated in EDA tools, which have been expanded to software, hardware and design methodologies (such as through design services),  this article in particular describes EDA specifically with respect to integrated circuits (ICs).\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:18:27.897036"}

They are unique because of their easily modular properties, which are a result of their size. These nanocrystals are composed of a quantum dot semiconducting core material and a shell of a distinct semiconducting material.  The core and the shell are typically composed of type II–VI, IV–VI, I-III-VI, and III–V semiconductors, with configurations such as CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, CuInZnSe/ZnS, CdSe/CdS, and InAs/CdSe (typical notation is: core/shell) Organically passivated quantum dots have low fluorescence quantum yield due to surface related trap states. CSSNCs address this problem because the shell increases quantum yield by passivating the surface trap states.  In addition, the shell provides protection against environmental changes, photo-oxidative degradation, and provides another route for modularity. Precise control of the size, shape, and composition of both the core and the shell enable the emission wavelength to be tuned over a wider range of wavelengths than with either individual semiconductor.  These materials have found applications in biological systems and optics.\n\n"}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T07:11:38.187352"}

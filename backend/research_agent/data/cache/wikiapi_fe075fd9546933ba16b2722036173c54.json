Compared to its predecessor DDR4 SDRAM, DDR5 was planned to reduce power consumption, while doubling bandwidth. The standard, originally targeted for 2018, was released on July 14, 2020.\nA new feature called Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) enables input/output (I/O) speed scalability for higher bandwidth and performance improvement. DDR5 has about the same 14 ns latency as DDR4 and DDR3. DDR5 octuples the maximum dual in-line memory module (DIMM) capacity from 64 GB to 512 GB. DDR5 also has higher frequencies than DDR4, up to 9.6 GT/s is currently possible, 8.2 GT/s translates into around 64 GB/s of bandwidth. Speeds of more than 13 GT/s have been achieved using liquid nitrogen.\nRambus announced a working DDR5 DIMM in September 2017. On November 15, 2018, SK Hynix announced completion of its first DDR5 RAM chip; running at 5.2 GT/s at 1.1 V. In February 2019, SK Hynix announced a 6.4 GT/s chip, the highest speed specified by the preliminary DDR5 standard. The first production DDR5 DRAM chip was officially launched by SK Hynix on October 6, 2020. \nThe separate JEDEC standard Low Power Double Data Rate 5 (LPDDR5), intended for laptops and smartphones, was released in February 2019.\nCompared to DDR4, DDR5 further reduces memory voltage to 1.1 V, a reduction from the 1.2 V required by DDR4. DDR5 modules incorporate on-board voltage regulators in order to reach higher speeds.\nIn 2024 the first CUDIMM (clocked unbuffered DIMM) and CSODIMM (clocked SODIMM) modules were introduced together with Intel Arrow Lake. These modules include a component to re-drive the clock signal to help reach higher speeds. AMD does not support CUDIMM, though Zen 5 will accept CUDIMMs in bypass mode."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:16:29.955538"}

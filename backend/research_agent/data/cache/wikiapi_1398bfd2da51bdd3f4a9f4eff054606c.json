This includes systems using single-phase or two-phase dielectric liquids, leveraging their thermal capabilities to manage and dissipate heat generated by electronic components.\nHeat is removed from the system by putting the coolant in direct contact with hot components, and circulating the heated liquid through heat exchangers. This practice is highly effective as liquid coolants can absorb more heat from the system than air. Immersion cooling has many benefits, including but not limited to: sustainability, performance, reliability, and cost.\nThe fluids used in immersion cooling are dielectric liquids to ensure that they can safely come into contact with energized electronic components. Commonly used dielectric liquids in immersion cooling are synthetic hydrocarbons, esters (natural and synthetic) and fluorochemicals."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-01-31T15:20:45.256892"}

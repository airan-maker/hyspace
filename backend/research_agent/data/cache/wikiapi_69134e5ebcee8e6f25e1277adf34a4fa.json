Technical experts from all over the world participate in the development of IEEE standards.\nIEEE SA provides a neutral platform that unites communities for standards development and technological innovation and is independent of any government oversight. IEEE SA develops standards that are consensus-based and has two types of standards development participation models. These are individual and entity.\nIEEE SA is not a body formally authorized by any government, but rather a community. ISO, International Electrotechnical Commissionaires and ITU are recognized international standards organizations. ISO members are national standards bodies such as American ANSI, German DIN or Japanese JISC. IEC members are so called National Committees, some of which are hosted by national standards bodies. These are not identical to ISO members. Both IEC and ISO develop International Standards that are consensus-based and follow the \"one country one vote principle\", representing broad industry needs. Their standards cannot be sponsored by individual companies or organizations.\nThe 2026-2026 IEEE SA President is Gary Hoffman, who has been active in IEEE for over 38 years. He is a member of the IEEE SA, IEEE Power & Energy Society, IEEE Magnetics Society, and the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society. Gary was elevated to IEEE Fellow in 2015 for leadership in the \"advancement of monitoring systems for power transformers and power line protection\" and was the 2024 recipient of the IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award. Previous Presidents of the IEEE SA include Jim Matthews (2023-2024, 2021-2022), Yu Yuan (2023), Robert Fish (2019-2020), F. Don Wright (2017-2018), Bruce Kraemer (2015-2016), and Karen Bartleson (2013-2014).\nThe 2025 Chair of the IEEE SA Standards Board (SASB) is Lei Wang. Previous SASB chairs include J.P. Faure, John Kulick, Gary Hoffman, and David Law.\nThe 2025 Chair of the IEEE SA Entity Collaborative Activities Governance Board (CAG) is Gary Stuebing. Previous chairs include Robby Simpson and Chuck Adams."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T06:21:53.356511"}

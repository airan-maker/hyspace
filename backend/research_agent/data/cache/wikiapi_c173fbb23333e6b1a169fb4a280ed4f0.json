Operating through informal consensus, CoCom maintained extensive control lists covering arms, nuclear materials, and dual-use technologies. However, CoCom faced criticism for weak enforcement and inconsistent application among member states. CoCom officially disbanded on March 31, 1994. However, many of its export restrictions remained in effect among member nations until they were formally replaced by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1996. CoCom's legacy continues to influence contemporary export control regimes, highlighting its enduring relevance in nonproliferation and technology policy."}}}}, "fetched_at": "2026-02-01T07:04:59.646173"}
